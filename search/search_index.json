Unlike other currency-focused blockchains, Scalaris is a service-based blockchain comprised of 3 main components: XRouter - Provides blockchain interoperability for the Blocknet Protocol with a communication layer consisting of a decentralized inter-blockchain SPV client backend that enables the verification of blockchain records without requiring users to download the full blockchain. XRouter allows applications to interface with blockchains on the TCP/IP networking layer, enabling a true Internet of Blockchains. By default, XRouter is compatible with all blockchains. XBridge - Provides the ability to perform trustless exchange between any digital assets that is supported by the Blocknet Protocol via APIs. XBridge allows any application to perform decentralized exchange, opening the door to an ecosystem of decentralized trading services. See the list of compatible assets . XCloud - Provides a decentralized oracle network powered by XRouter. XCloud allows applications to run entirely decentralized by enabling on-chain use of off-chain data, APIs, and services, opening the door to the possibility of monetizable, fully decentralized applications. The Blocknet Protocol is designed to maximize interoperability between different blockchains through the use of these components. Just as the internet connected computers, the Blocknet Protocol is critical for blockchains to communicate and realize full potential . Nodes \u00b6 The network is powered by 2 types of nodes: Staking Nodes - Secures the network by staking SCA to verify the blockchain. This service earns 100% of block rewards and the fees for transactions in that block. Service Nodes - Hosts the full nodes of compatible blockchains, serves oracle data, audits interactions, and performs anti-spam and anti-DOS measures for the network. This service earns 100% of fees generated from use of the network's services ( XBridge , XRouter , XCloud ). The following are the requirements to operate each type of node: Staking Nodes - A Staking Node can be operated with any amount of SCA, but staking more SCA yields more frequent rewards. Service Nodes - A Service Node requires 2500 SCA. Tokenomics \u00b6 SCA is the utility token that powers the Scalaris. Fees are paid in SCA when using the network and 100% of those fees are distributed to Service Nodes for supporting the network and infrastructure. Normal transaction fees on the network are also paid in SCA and awarded to stakers. If seeking to acquire SCA, there are various options available . Scalaris involves multiple economic models with respect to the use of the SCA token. Block Rewards - Scalaris is Proof-of-Stake(PoS) with 1 SCA created every minute which is awarded to stakers. Stakers also receive the network transaction fees for the block they have validated. Read more about staking rewards . Service Fees - Service Nodes receive 100% of SCA fees generated from the use of services on the network, including trades performed via XBridge, interfacing with blockchains via XRouter, and use of microservices via XCloud. Collateral - SCA is required for collateral to operate a Service Node, as well as to use certain services on the network. Governance - Submitting proposals to the network requires a fee to be paid in SCA and proposals can only be voted on by Service Nodes. Transaction Fees - Transferring funds on the network incurs a transaction fee that's paid in SCA and awarded to stakers. The utility of the SCA token increases the buy pressure on the market, while the reward potential of operating a node reduces sell pressure on the market. // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = []; Related Links \u00b6 var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

Since order broadcast and order matching are completely decentralized, there are no bottlenecks other than the ones which lie with users, namely their local internet connections. In addition though, there is a shared capacity in the broadcasting system, which is extremely high. Here is a relevant quotation from a Bitcoin wiki : Bitcoin Wiki Let's assume an average rate of 2000tps, so just VISA. Transactions vary in size from about 0.2 kilobytes to over 1 kilobyte, but it's averaging half a kilobyte today. That means that you need to keep up with around 8 megabits/second of transaction data (2000tps * 512 bytes) / 1024 bytes in a kilobyte / 1024 kilobytes in a megabyte = 0.97 megabytes per second * 8 = 7.8 megabits/second. This sort of bandwidth is already common for even residential connections today, and is certainly at the low end of what colocation providers would expect to provide you with. When blocks are solved, the current protocol will send the transactions again, even if a peer has already seen it at broadcast time. Fixing this to make blocks just list of hashes would resolve the issue and make the bandwidth needed for block broadcast negligible. So whilst this optimization isn't fully implemented today, we do not consider block transmission bandwidth here. SCA Inflation \u00b6 While there is no maximum limit due to the Scalaris blockchain being Proof of Stake, there is a limit to the amount that can be minted per period (limited inflation).

Voting on proposals is important for the decentralized governance model to function properly. Voting Requirements & Important Information 2500 SCA is required in order to vote. The process of voting can take place from a wallet containing at least 2500 SCA, or a Service Node collateral wallet. An active Service Node is not required. Voting for proposals ends 106 blocks prior the Superblock. It'd be safer to make sure you vote no later than 107 blocks before the Superblock to make sure your voting transaction gets at least 1 confirmation. The inputs (UTXOs) used for the 2500 SCA (to vote) must be 100 SCA or larger. The inputs used for the 2500 SCA must be in the same address. Since the votes are recorded on-chain, casting a vote requires you to pay a network fee. This requires each address to have an input separate from the inputs used for the 2500 SCA to pay for the network fees. This input used for the fee cannot be immature . Funds will remain immature for about 60 minutes (60 blocks) after they staked. If you are staking, your vote will automatically re-cast. Your vote is not counted until the voting transaction fee has 1 confirmation (typically 1 minute), after which your votes will be accounted for when viewing the listproposals command. If you vote again you will have to pay another network fee to do so. The voting system will automatically calculate how many votes you have available according to your balance (1 vote per 2500 SCA) and cast your full vote weight when voting (4999 SCA balance = 1 vote, 49635 SCA balance = 19 votes. The deadline for creating proposals is 2000 blocks prior to the Superblock. Examples Of Valid Input Setups Counts as 1 single vote: Address A Inputs: 1250, 1250, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 5000 + 1 (tx fee input) Counts as 1 single vote: Address A Inputs: 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 2500 + 1 (tx fee input) Counts as 1 single vote wth excess (inefficient): Address A Inputs: 1000, 1250, 1250, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 3500 + 1 (tx fee input) Address B Inputs: 1500 + 1 (tx fee input) Total: 1500 + 1 (tx fee input) Counts as 1 vote (inefficient): Address A Inputs: 1000, 1000, 500, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 2500 + 1 (tx fee input) Address B Inputs: 2000, 500 Total: 2500 (no tx fee input) Counts as 2 votes: Address A Inputs: 1000, 1000, 1500, 1500, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 5000 + 1 (tx fee input) Counts as 3 votes with excess (inefficient): Address A Inputs: 2500, 2000, 1000, 500, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 6000 + 1 (tx fee input) Address B Inputs: 1000, 1000, 500, 1000, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 3500 + 1 (tx fee input) Examples Of Invalid Input Setups Not at least 2500 SCA: Address A Inputs: 1250, 1200, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 2450 + 1 (tx fee input) Not enought to cover fee: Address A Inputs: 1250, 1250 Total: 2500 Fee is not a separate input: Address A Inputs: 1251, 1250 Total: 2501 2500 SCA not in a single address: Address A Inputs: 2000, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 2000 + 1 (tx fee input) Address B Inputs: 500, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 500 + 1 (tx fee input) Proposals should be carefully reviewed along with the amount requested. It's a good idea to consider the total Superblock budget (30,000 SCA), the other proposals amounts requested, the priorities of the project, and if the proposal aligns with those priorities and greater vision of the project. The link for each proposal should lead to a description of what the proposal is for with background information and objectives. See how to view proposals . Voting from the Qt Wallet \u00b6 Vote using the redesigned wallet Open the wallet and in the side menu, go to Proposals . The wallet needs to be unlocked to cast votes. The Proposals screen shows all the proposals submitted to the network. Above the list of proposals there is an option to filter by Upcoming , which displays the proposals that can currently be voted on. Select this filter to view all proposals currently open for voting. Review the proposals and the amount requested.

When ready to vote on a proposal, select the Vote button. A popup will appear that will be used to vote from. Select whether you'd like to approve the proposal ( Yes ) or vote against the proposal ( No ). After you have selected how you wish to vote, select the Vote button. This registers your vote to the network after the vote transaction has 1 confirmation (about 1 minute). Once you have voted you can change your vote by selecting the Cast Votes button and selecting you new vote. Voting Complete! Repeat this process for every proposal you are voting for. Your vote is not counted until the voting transaction fee has 1 confirmation (typically 1 minute), after which your votes will be accounted for. If you spend any of your 2500 SCA inputs after you vote, the vote is marked invalid and you will need to cast your vote(s) again. If you are staking, your vote will automatically re-cast.

Voting on proposals is important for the decentralized governance model to function properly. Voting Requirements & Important Information 2500 SCA is required in order to vote. The process of voting can take place from a wallet containing at least 2500 SCA, or a Service Node collateral wallet. An active Service Node is not required. Voting for proposals ends 106 blocks prior the Superblock. It'd be safer to make sure you vote no later than 107 blocks before the Superblock to make sure your voting transaction gets at least 1 confirmation. The inputs (UTXOs) used for the 2500 SCA (to vote) must be 100 SCA or larger. The inputs used for the 2500 SCA must be in the same address. Since the votes are recorded on-chain, casting a vote requires you to pay a network fee. This requires each address to have an input separate from the inputs used for the 2500 SCA to pay for the network fees. This input used for the fee cannot be immature . Funds will remain immature for about 60 minutes (60 blocks) after they staked. If you are staking, your vote will automatically re-cast. Your vote is not counted until the voting transaction fee has 1 confirmation (typically 1 minute), after which your votes will be accounted for when viewing the listproposals command. If you vote again you will have to pay another network fee to do so. The voting system will automatically calculate how many votes you have available according to your balance (1 vote per 2500 SCA) and cast your full vote weight when voting (4999 SCA balance = 1 vote, 49635 SCA balance = 19 votes. The deadline for creating proposals is 2000 blocks prior to the Superblock. Examples Of Valid Input Setups Counts as 1 single vote: Address A Inputs: 1250, 1250, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 5000 + 1 (tx fee input) Counts as 1 single vote: Address A Inputs: 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 2500 + 1 (tx fee input) Counts as 1 single vote wth excess (inefficient): Address A Inputs: 1000, 1250, 1250, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 3500 + 1 (tx fee input) Address B Inputs: 1500 + 1 (tx fee input) Total: 1500 + 1 (tx fee input) Counts as 1 vote (inefficient): Address A Inputs: 1000, 1000, 500, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 2500 + 1 (tx fee input) Address B Inputs: 2000, 500 Total: 2500 (no tx fee input) Counts as 2 votes: Address A Inputs: 1000, 1000, 1500, 1500, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 5000 + 1 (tx fee input) Counts as 3 votes with excess (inefficient): Address A Inputs: 2500, 2000, 1000, 500, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 6000 + 1 (tx fee input) Address B Inputs: 1000, 1000, 500, 1000, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 3500 + 1 (tx fee input) Examples Of Invalid Input Setups Not at least 2500 SCA: Address A Inputs: 1250, 1200, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 2450 + 1 (tx fee input) Not enought to cover fee: Address A Inputs: 1250, 1250 Total: 2500 Fee is not a separate input: Address A Inputs: 1251, 1250 Total: 2501 2500 SCA not in a single address: Address A Inputs: 2000, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 2000 + 1 (tx fee input) Address B Inputs: 500, 1 (tx fee input) Total: 500 + 1 (tx fee input) Proposals should be carefully reviewed along with the amount requested. It's a good idea to consider the total Superblock budget (30,000 SCA), the other proposals amounts requested, the priorities of the project, and if the proposal aligns with those priorities and greater vision of the project.

It's a good idea to consider the total Superblock budget (30,000 SCA), the other proposals amounts requested, the priorities of the project, and if the proposal aligns with those priorities and greater vision of the project. The link for each proposal should lead to a description of what the proposal is for with background information and objectives. View using wallet Open the wallet and in the side menu, go to Proposals . The wallet does not need to be unlocked. The Proposals screen shows all the proposals submitted to the network.

The project was founded on the principles of openness, transparency, and maintaining a high level of decentralization. These principles apply to both our community and protocol, which are aimed to bring blockchains and communities together. Scalaris is unique in that there is no company or foundation behind the project. Instead, Scalaris is self-governed by its stakeholders, meaning that stakers, token-holders, Service Node operators and others with a stake in the blockchain have the ability to make decisions together. This self-governance is maintained through a Superblock mechanism, as well as open communication in our Discord . The project is also open-source, meaning anybody can contribute. From development, to content creation, to tools and services, we welcome all and encourage you to take part! You have the freedom to lead up your own project, collaborate with others at your own pace, or come and go as you please. We\u2019re also always working to develop and improve our collaboration process, so if there\u2019s any suggestions on ways to better the process we\u2019d love to hear it! At Scalaris, we take pride in the level of decentralization the project and protocol maintains. We invite you to join us in our vision of a collaborative blockchain ecosystem. Vision \u00b6 The future Scalaris sees for blockchain is a highly collaborative microservice ecosystem. At the moment, there are many projects that try to provide as many features as possible in a single blockchain, resulting in the finished product being inefficient and bloated. This is called monolithic architecture and is generally considered poor practice in software development. We envision an ecosystem of single-purpose microservice blockchains that perform one task really well and are secure, reliable, and efficient. These microservice blockchains can then be consumed by dApps and other blockchains to build more complex, yet modular, services. This type of architecture is made possible with the Blocknet Protocol. Just as the internet enabled computers to communicate, the Blocknet Protocol enables an internet of blockchains, which is critical for the ecosystem to realize its full potential. Development If developing a dApp, in the current state of the ecosystem a developer must choose between either developing on an existing platform such as Ethereum, forking a project with similar traits, or building a blockchain from scratch. However, with the use of the Blocknet Protocol, it makes development blockchain-agnostic. This means development can occur on any chain and the features needed can be pulled in from other blockchains. For instance, if building a dApp on Ethereum and needed a storage solution, the dApp will be able to use the protocol to communicate with Siacoin or Storj or any other storage blockchain to consume their services. If the dApp needed to perform heavy computations, Golem or Sonm could be used. If the dApp had a payment aspect, payments can be made in Bitcoin or Litecoin, which are more widely supported by vendors. The protocol enables the use of services from other chains similar to the way libraries are used in traditional software development, allowing developers to focus on the business logic of the application. This technology helps future proof development and also helps monetize blockchain services as features on blockchains are consumed. Supply Chain In supply chain, there will be multiple blockchains being used at various steps of the process much like there is today with traditional software stacks. The Blocknet Protocol would allow information to be accessible between these different blockchains.

The project was founded on the principles of openness, transparency, and maintaining a high level of decentralization. These principles apply to both our community and protocol, which are aimed to bring blockchains and communities together. Scalaris is unique in that there is no company or foundation behind the project. Instead, Scalaris is self-governed by its stakeholders, meaning that stakers, token-holders, Service Node operators and others with a stake in the blockchain have the ability to make decisions together. This self-governance is maintained through a Superblock mechanism, as well as open communication in our Discord . The project is also open-source, meaning anybody can contribute. From development, to content creation, to tools and services, we welcome all and encourage you to take part! You have the freedom to lead up your own project, collaborate with others at your own pace, or come and go as you please. We\u2019re also always working to develop and improve our collaboration process, so if there\u2019s any suggestions on ways to better the process we\u2019d love to hear it! At Scalaris, we take pride in the level of decentralization the project and protocol maintains. We invite you to join us in our vision of a collaborative blockchain ecosystem.","title":"Background"},{"location":"project/introduction/#vision","text":"The future Scalaris sees for blockchain is a highly collaborative microservice ecosystem. At the moment, there are many projects that try to provide as many features as possible in a single blockchain, resulting in the finished product being inefficient and bloated. This is called monolithic architecture and is generally considered poor practice in software development. We envision an ecosystem of single-purpose microservice blockchains that perform one task really well and are secure, reliable, and efficient. These microservice blockchains can then be consumed by dApps and other blockchains to build more complex, yet modular, services. This type of architecture is made possible with the Blocknet Protocol. Just as the internet enabled computers to communicate, the Blocknet Protocol enables an internet of blockchains, which is critical for the ecosystem to realize its full potential. Development If developing a dApp, in the current state of the ecosystem a developer must choose between either developing on an existing platform such as Ethereum, forking a project with similar traits, or building a blockchain from scratch. However, with the use of the Blocknet Protocol, it makes development blockchain-agnostic. This means development can occur on any chain and the features needed can be pulled in from other blockchains. For instance, if building a dApp on Ethereum and needed a storage solution, the dApp will be able to use the protocol to communicate with Siacoin or Storj or any other storage blockchain to consume their services. If the dApp needed to perform heavy computations, Golem or Sonm could be used. If the dApp had a payment aspect, payments can be made in Bitcoin or Litecoin, which are more widely supported by vendors. The protocol enables the use of services from other chains similar to the way libraries are used in traditional software development, allowing developers to focus on the business logic of the application. This technology helps future proof development and also helps monetize blockchain services as features on blockchains are consumed. Supply Chain In supply chain, there will be multiple blockchains being used at various steps of the process much like there is today with traditional software stacks. The Blocknet Protocol would allow information to be accessible between these different blockchains. For instance, pharmaceutical manufacturers have strict regulations to follow and need to provide certain information and assurances. Being able to access lot information from the raw materials being consumed, temperature and humidity information during transportation, and final destinations are all important. The Blocknet Protocol would enable this communication to occur in a trustless matter, which is important to ensure validity of the information. // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = [];","title":"Vision"},{"location":"project/introduction/#related-links","text":"var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

All existing holdings, fees, rewards, and collaterals will be increased proportionally. This change is needed to preemptively address an anticipated technical problem regarding microfees and dust amounts. Note: If you own SCA, your own balance will multiply by 100.

When sending really small amounts the network transaction fee also accounts for a larger percent of the total amount sent. These two things pose an issue for XRouter, where it's important to support really small micro fees for services. As the dollar ($USD) value of SCA increases, so does the limit for how small of a dollar ($USD) value you can send. This means that even at the smallest available amount to send, XRouter transactions can become expensive which isn't good as you want to be able to support those micro fees. Rather than waiting until this issue comes to a head resulting in an emergency hard fork, we would like to get ahead of the problem. Comments from 86B on Discord regarding dust amounts Lets say we moved the relay fee out to match BTCs at 0.00001. Using the 2000bytes example, sending a $0.005 (half cent) microfee would be charged $0.02 by the network for a 366% charge. Now lets assume we make XRouter transactions feeless. At $2000/SCA (optimists anyone?), we'd see minimum transactions required to be over $0.01 - effectively not allowing us to charge under a penny for various simple XRouter calls/etc. So despite changing the feeperbyte, changing the minrelaytxfee, etc - we'll still eventually run into this issue. It's easier to just move the decimals out and be done with it for good. Solution \u00b6 A hard fork will be required to undertake this and would not incur any costs to owners of SCA.

This proposal is for use of the Burn Fund ( BpzPFJaaKQVSvfiH7zXSUdPBrBnfx9v26V ) and to increase the Superblock from 4,320 SCA to 40,000 SCA. Please continue reading to understand the reasoning and the need for this. To better understand the financial state of the project, a more comprehensive tracking sheet has been created after feedback from the community, which can be seen here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xFm5LJsRNN62-9XZFqfDckUt2x8ps3pUOBISUxNQYpc/ In this financial sheet, you can see the remaining funds (Balance Summary), a breakdown of expenses (Expense Summary), the relation of expenses to price of SCA (Expense Charts), and projected expenses moving forward (Projected Expenses). This sheet will be referenced throughout the proposal. Current Expenses \u00b6 Many expenses and functions within this project have been cut in response to the market decline and subsequently the value of SCA (Expense Charts, Total Expenses vs SCA Price). The project has had to make many sacrifices by making cuts to developers, the office, marketing initiatives, other contributors, and cuts in pay to remaining contributors (Projected Expenses, E3:F22). Current expenses for next month (Projected Expenses, A3:C24) are down to the absolute minimum to support core functions, with a projected estimated monthly expense of $35,400 + 1,045 SCA (mixed denominations because some request amounts in SCA). At the current price of $1.75 SCA, a total of 21,274 SCA is needed to support the project. If the market falls further, at $1.00 SCA the project would need 36,445 SCA to sustain itself. Funding Remaining \u00b6 The project currently has 15,618 SCA remaining (Balance Summary, D12), which includes a maximum of 4,320 from the Superblock. At the current burn rate of the project, the remaining funds will not be able to support the core functions of this project and will be depleted this month. After that point, the project will be solely dependent on the the Superblock, which is not sufficient to support even 1 full time developer. Solution \u00b6 The proposed solution for overcoming the current financial situation comes in 2 parts: Increasing the Superblock to give a stronger guarantee of covering our operational expenses. Using the Burn Fund to provide us with a safety net against the future potential (downwards) movement of the market. No amount of cutting expenses changes the fact that the Superblock can't cover the project's operating costs, even when restricted to core functions. The price of SCA would need to be $11 (6x increase) for it to sustain just the bare minimum of operations. Increasing the Superblock to 40,000 SCA will not only guarantee funding if the price of SCA drops to $1, but as the price of SCA increases, it would provide the project enough funds to do the following: Compete with the larger, well-funded players in the market. At the moment every contributor has their hands full with tasks. An increased budget will allow for more contributors, allowing us to more evenly distribute tasks, expand the team and move more rapidly as a project. As an example of what we're competing against as a project, Komodo (KMD) has 10 Administration and Support staff, 8 Marketing, and Business Development staff. Attract investors with additional large exchange listings. As the market picks up and the price of SCA recovers, there will be funds available for market makers and the opportunity to get listed on larger exchanges, which will create a healthier market for SCA, making the project more attractive to investors. Attract partners and integrators. Additional funds will provide the ability to host/sponsor hackathons, create an incubator program where integrators can apply for funding to start developing software that utilizes the Blocknet Protocol, and entice potential partners. Attract and retain developers. In addition to hackathons, which would help attract developers, having the funds to pay developers for contributing to the project is also a necessity to build the technical contributor base. Please note that not all of the Superblock needs to be utilized. At the same time, this increase provides potential future opportunity for the project to grow and expand. In addition to an increased Superblock, we are proposing use of the Burn Funds. The Burn Fund currently contains \u2248127k SCA, is already unlocked and in the team\u2019s control, and is accounted for in the circulation. The proposed distribution is as follows: Ecosystem Growth Fund - 10k SCA Marketing Fund - 10k SCA Business Development Fund - 7k SCA Development Fund - 100k SCA The point of having both the Superblock and using the Burn Fund is two-fold. The update to increase the Superblock will take 2-3 months to coordinate with exchanges to prevent forking so the Burn Fund will provide funding in the interim. Without the increased Superblock and just using the Burn Funds, the project will only have a runway of 8 months at the current SCA price. Having both the Superblock and the Burn Fund is also beneficial to secure Scalaris's funding into the future. With increasing the Superblock to a point where it can sustain the project, more proposals for expenses can be voted on by Service Nodes and the Community Funds would remain as a true \u2018reserve fund\u2019 (as was originally intended). This is the most ideal scenario to make sure the project remains financially stable. Liquidation \u00b6 Some may be concerned about liquidation when increasing the Superblock. This should not be a concern as the market has been absorbing the Superblock and additional expenses just fine. However, we will also be opting to selling funds on the DX when possible as opposed to CEXs and are in contact with a handful of community members that are interested in OTC to help take unneeded sell pressure off the market. Conclusion \u00b6 This project is in a dire financial situation and it's not even operating at the capacity it should be. These measures will not only secure Scalaris's funding, but also provide strong future growth to allow maturation as a project and product(s) that are fully capable of competing with the rest of the market. // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = []; Related Links \u00b6 var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

When paired with XRouter, any application can perform exchanges between any compatible blockchains using a decentralized SPV implementation. Unlike every other \"decentralized\" exchange protocols, no derivatives (proxy tokens or colored coins) are used and the entire process is done in a trustless manner by decentralizing the four components of an exchange: Storage of Funds - Trading occurs directly out of the client's wallet and funds are within the client's control throughout the entire process. Order Books - Orders are broadcasted directly peer-to-peer over the network. Each client compiles the order book themselves instead of relying on a central order book service. All integrators and services on the protocol share the orderbook and liquidity. Currently there is just support for a public order book, but there are plans for private order books and direct trading as well. Order Matching - This is performed peer-to-peer by the clients. Settlement - This is performed using BIP65 CLTV atomic swap contracts [1] . For blockchains that do not inherently support BIP65, such as Ethereum, similar methods are being emulated to extend the protocol to those blockchains and subsequent assets. [1] ACCT using Check Lock Time Verify (#4) The exchange takes place on each respective blockchain with the process overlooked by a network of Service Nodes running full nodes of the compatible blockchains to ensure no malicious behavior is occurring. Note that once an exchange is completed, when the funds are received will be dependent on the blockchain's accepted confirmation time. By default, the required amount of confirmations is set 0 and the funds aren't spent until each blockchain achieves their respective required amount of confirmations. For instance, lets look at an example of an exchange between BTC requiring 1 confirmation and SCA requiring 2 confirmations. SCA has a faster confirmation time so it will receive 2 confirmations while BTC has 0, but the funds will not be spent until SCA has at least 2 confirmation and BTC has at least 1 confirmation.

When paired with XRouter, any application can perform exchanges between any compatible blockchains using a decentralized SPV implementation. Unlike every other \"decentralized\" exchange protocols, no derivatives (proxy tokens or colored coins) are used and the entire process is done in a trustless manner by decentralizing the four components of an exchange: Storage of Funds - Trading occurs directly out of the client's wallet and funds are within the client's control throughout the entire process. Order Books - Orders are broadcasted directly peer-to-peer over the network. Each client compiles the order book themselves instead of relying on a central order book service. All integrators and services on the protocol share the orderbook and liquidity. Currently there is just support for a public order book, but there are plans for private order books and direct trading as well. Order Matching - This is performed peer-to-peer by the clients. Settlement - This is performed using BIP65 CLTV atomic swap contracts [1] . For blockchains that do not inherently support BIP65, such as Ethereum, similar methods are being emulated to extend the protocol to those blockchains and subsequent assets. [1] ACCT using Check Lock Time Verify (#4) The exchange takes place on each respective blockchain with the process overlooked by a network of Service Nodes running full nodes of the compatible blockchains to ensure no malicious behavior is occurring. Note that once an exchange is completed, when the funds are received will be dependent on the blockchain's accepted confirmation time. By default, the required amount of confirmations is set 0 and the funds aren't spent until each blockchain achieves their respective required amount of confirmations. For instance, lets look at an example of an exchange between BTC requiring 1 confirmation and SCA requiring 2 confirmations. SCA has a faster confirmation time so it will receive 2 confirmations while BTC has 0, but the funds will not be spent until SCA has at least 2 confirmation and BTC has at least 1 confirmation.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"protocol/xbridge/introduction/#design","text":"The following diagrams depict the events of an exchange with various outcomes.

If you have not yet setup the Scalaris wallet, start with the Wallet Setup Guide . XBridge is a decentralized exchange protocol with the ability to perform non-custodial, trustless, and decentralized exchange between any digital assets that is supported by the Blocknet Protocol. XBridge allows any application to perform decentralized exchange, opening the door to an ecosystem of decentralized trading services. For each market you would like to trade on, you must run the full nodes of those blockchains in addition to the Scalaris wallet. For example, if you are trading on the BTC-LTC market, you must have the Scalaris, Litecoin, and Bitcoin wallets fully synced and running locally. Note: Full nodes are required. Lite wallets and Electrum wallets are not supported. You must run full blockchain nodes with txindex=1 . In order to check if you are running a full node, use the getblockchaininfo command. You should see \"pruned\": false, if you are running a full node. If you see \"pruned\": true, then make sure txindex=1 is in that wallet's configureation file and restart the wallet. See the list of compatible blockchains . A third party is working on implementing a lite multiwallet solution based off XRouter, but this has not been released yet. To setup XBridge, follow these steps: Configure Wallet Confs Configure XBridge Conf Next Steps To configure XBridge, Scalaris's xbridge.conf file and the wallet configuration files for each supported blockchain must be setup properly. Configuration is specific to the blockchain and wallet version. Here is a list of compatible blockchains and wallet versions . All configuration files can be found in the blockchain-configuration-files Github repo . Scalaris uses a manifest ( view manifest ) to determine which configurations to use based off the blockchain and wallet version. The manifest uses a code-friendly format called JSON. This manifest uses \"version groups\", which is a group of wallet versions for a blockchain that pertain to a specific set of configurations. A blockchain can have multiple version groups, each with different sets of wallet versions. Each version group is separated by {curly brackets} and contains similar sets of information. The information you will need to focus on is the following: Key Example Data (Bitcoin) Description blockchain Bitcoin The name of the blockchain. ticker BTC The blockchain's ticker. ver_name Bitcoin v0.16.x Version group name. versions [\"v0.16.0\",\"v0.16.1\",\"v0.16.2\",\"v0.16.3\"] The wallet versions compatible with this version group. xbridge_conf bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf Filename of XBridge configs for these wallet version. wallet_conf bitcoin--v0.16.0.conf Filename of wallet config for these wallet versions. Configure Wallet Confs \u00b6 In the manifest , find the version group for the blockchain you want to trade. For example, if you want to trade Bitcoin and have wallet version 0.17.0.1 then find the version group that says \"blockchain\": \"Bitcoin\" and has \"v0.17.0.1\" listed under \"versions\" . There are multiple version groups for Bitcoin, but only 1 version group with v0.17.0.1 listed under it: { \"blockchain\": \"Bitcoin\", \"ticker\": \"BTC\", \"ver_id\": \"bitcoin--v0.17.0\", \"ver_name\": \"Bitcoin v0.17.x\", \"conf_name\": \"bitcoin.conf\", \"dir_name_linux\": \"bitcoin\", \"dir_name_mac\": \"Bitcoin\", \"dir_name_win\": \"Bitcoin\", \"repo_url\": \"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\", \"versions\": [ \"v0.17.0\", \"v0.17.0.1\", \"v0.17.1\" ], \"xbridge_conf\": \"bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf\", \"wallet_conf\": \"bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf\" }, Take a note of the \"wallet_conf\" filename. For Bitcoin v0.17.0.1 it is bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf . Navigate to the wallet-confs/ folder of the blockchain configuration files repo: https://github.com/scalaris-project/blockchain-configuration-files/tree/master/wallet-confs Open the file with the filename listed in the version group. For Bitcoin v0.17.0.1, filename bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf , that would be this file: https://github.com/scalaris-project/blockchain-configuration-files/blob/master/wallet-confs/bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf Copy that file's contents. These are the contents of bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf : server=1 listen=1 rpcuser= rpcpassword= rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 port=8333 rpcport=8332 txindex=1 # Legacy addresses must be used (address must begin with \"1\", not \"3\") addresstype=legacy changetype=legacy # Enable deprecated calls deprecatedrpc=signrawtransaction Open the wallet's configuration file. For Bitcoin this is bitcoin.conf . Delete any contents in this file. This is important because and duplicate settings can mess with the configuration. Paste the previously copied file contents into the wallet's configuration file. Enter a username and password for rpcuser= and rpcpassword= . These should be difficult and secure credentials. Enter the IP of your Scalaris client for rpcallowip= . If this blockchain will be hosted on the same computer as the Scalaris client, use rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 (localhost). Save the configuration file. If the blockchain's wallet has been open, you will ned to restart it to load the updated configurations. Repeat this process for each blockchain you want to trade. There's an additional dxnowallets= setting unique to the scalaris.conf . If set to 1 , you will aggregate orders for all markets, not just for your connected assets. This is useful for view-only and browsing purposes. You will still need the wallets connected for any market you want to trade on. If a dxnowallets= setting is specified, it will override the ShowAllOrders= setting in your xbridge.conf header. XBridge Conf \u00b6 In the manifest , find the version group for the blockchain you want to trade.

Navigate to the xbridge-confs/ folder of the blockchain configuration files repo: https://github.com/scalaris-project/blockchain-configuration-files/tree/master/xbridge-confs Open the file with the filename listed in the version group. For Bitcoin v0.17.0.1, filename bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf , that would be this file: https://github.com/scalaris-project/blockchain-configuration-files/blob/master/xbridge-confs/bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf Copy that file's contents.

This file can be found in the Scalaris wallet data directory. This file is used to tell the Scalaris wallet how to communicate with the other wallets. At the beginning of the file, enter the following main settings: [Main] ShowAllOrders= ExchangeWallets= FullLog=true After the [Main] settings, paste the previously copied file contents. Repeat this process and paste in the XBridge configurations for other blockchains. Update each blockchain's Username= , Password= , and Ip= setting with the rpcuser= , rpcpassword= , and rpcallowip= values from the respective wallet conf file. The Address= setting can be left blank. Update Confirmations= to how many confirmations you would for the asset the counterparty is trading. There are many security protections and precautions already in place, but this is recommended to be set to at least 1 for congested networks and networks with highly fluctuating fees to make sure transactions aren't kicked out of the mempool. This is already set to Confirmations=1 by default for any networks that are deemed to meet this criteria. The ShowAllOrders= is optional. If set to true , you will aggregate orders for all markets, not just for your connected assets. This is useful for view-only and browsing purposes. You will still need the wallets connected for any market you want to trade on. If a dxnowallets= setting is specified in your scalaris.conf file it will override this ShowAllOrders= setting. In the ExchangeWallets= entry in xbridge.conf add the all blockchains you want to trade, denoted by the chain's asset's ticker. Separate each ticker with a comma (no space). Example: ExchangeWallets=SCA,LTC,BTC,SYS Save the xbridge.conf file. If the blockchain's wallet has been open, you will need to restart it to load the updated configurations. Alternatively, the dxLoadXBridgeConf command can be used from either the Debug Console or the command line.

There's an additional dxnowallets= setting unique to the scalaris.conf . If set to 1 , you will aggregate orders for all markets, not just for your connected assets.

Navigate to the xbridge-confs/ folder of the blockchain configuration files repo: https://github.com/scalaris-project/blockchain-configuration-files/tree/master/xbridge-confs Open the file with the filename listed in the version group. For Bitcoin v0.17.0.1, filename bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf , that would be this file: https://github.com/scalaris-project/blockchain-configuration-files/blob/master/xbridge-confs/bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf Copy that file's contents. These are the contents of bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf : [BTC] Title=Bitcoin Address= Ip=127.0.0.1 Port=8332 Username= Password= AddressPrefix=0 ScriptPrefix=5 SecretPrefix=128 COIN=100000000 MinimumAmount=0 TxVersion=2 DustAmount=0 CreateTxMethod=BTC MinTxFee=7500 BlockTime=600 GetNewKeySupported=false ImportWithNoScanSupported=false FeePerByte=120 Confirmations=1 Open the xbridge.conf file. This file can be found in the Scalaris wallet data directory. This file is used to tell the Scalaris wallet how to communicate with the other wallets. At the beginning of the file, enter the following main settings: [Main] ShowAllOrders= ExchangeWallets= FullLog=true After the [Main] settings, paste the previously copied file contents. Repeat this process and paste in the XBridge configurations for other blockchains. Update each blockchain's Username= , Password= , and Ip= setting with the rpcuser= , rpcpassword= , and rpcallowip= values from the respective wallet conf file. The Address= setting can be left blank. Update Confirmations= to how many confirmations you would for the asset the counterparty is trading. There are many security protections and precautions already in place, but this is recommended to be set to at least 1 for congested networks and networks with highly fluctuating fees to make sure transactions aren't kicked out of the mempool. This is already set to Confirmations=1 by default for any networks that are deemed to meet this criteria. The ShowAllOrders= is optional. If set to true , you will aggregate orders for all markets, not just for your connected assets. This is useful for view-only and browsing purposes. You will still need the wallets connected for any market you want to trade on. If a dxnowallets= setting is specified in your scalaris.conf file it will override this ShowAllOrders= setting.

Here is a list of current SPV calls: Call Description xrGetBlockCount Returns a blockchain's block height xrGetBlockHash Returns a block number's hash xrGetBlock Returns a block hash's block number xrGetBlocks Returns block hashes for multiple block numbers xrDecodeRawTransaction Returns decoded transaction HEX xrGetTransaction Returns transaction data for transaction ID xrGetTransactions Returns transaction data for multiple transaction IDs xrSendTransaction Submit a signed transaction to the network To use XRouter, see the XRouter API and Setup Guide . Service Nodes earn 100% of fees from XBridge , XRouter, and XCloud services. If you'd like to operate your own Service Node, see the Service Node Setup Guide . Design \u00b6 The XRouter system utilizes the Service Node network to route calls from the client directly to the respective blockchain. There are 2 types of XRouter calls: submissions and queries. XRouter submissions are calls that involve interactions with a blockchain, such as xrSendTransaction . With submissions, the packets are routed from the client to the respective blockchain and a response, if any, is routed back to the client. XRouter queries are calls requesting information from a blockchain, such as xrGetBlockCount . With queries, the packets are also routed from the client to the respective blockchain and the response of the information queried is routed back to the client. XRouter queries can require a specific amount of Service Nodes to receive a response from in order to achieve consensus on the final answer. XRouter Overview (view full size image) The following diagrams depict the events of an XRouter query and submission. As seen in the diagrams, a \"client\" refers to software utilizing the Blocknet Protocol, which can be a blockchain, microservice, dApp, mobile app, website, etc. XRouter Query (view full size image) The flow of the diagram is top-to-bottom: The client dispatches a packet for a query via API call to the Service Node network. The Service Nodes supporting the queried blockchain receive the packet. The Service Nodes route the packet of the query to the blockchain. The Service Nodes route the response from the blockchain back to the client. The client receives all responses, as well as a response for a majority consensus on the answer. XRouter Submission (view full size image) The client dispatches a packet for a submission via API call to the Service Node network. The Service Nodes supporting the desired blockchain receive the packet. The Service Nodes route the packet of the query to the blockchain. If there is a response from the blockchain, the Service Nodes route the response back to the client. Namespace \u00b6 XRouter SPV wallets utlize the xr:: namespace while XCloud services utilize the xrs:: namespace. A list of the SPV wallets and services can be viewed using xrGetNetworkServices and you can pre-connect to the nodes with xrConnect . Node Scoring \u00b6 Clients keep a local score of each Service Node (network-wide repuation system is planned). When a Service Node reaches a score of -200 , the Service Node will be banned by the client for a 24hr period. After this 24hr period, the Service Node will start with a score of -25 . The ban score threshold can be adjusted using the xrouterbanscore setting in scalaris.conf (see setup ). This scoring used for both XRouter and XCloud . Action Change in Score Failure to respond to call within 30s -25 Failure to meet majority consensus -5 Matching consensus correct_nodes * 2 Sending bad XRouter config -10 Sending bad XCloud config -2 Fees \u00b6 With XRouter, and subsequently XCloud , fees are determined by a free market. Service Nodes can specify the fee that they wish to charge for a call and client can specify the max fee they are willing to pay for calls. Use Cases \u00b6 The applications for XRouter are as vast and imaginative as the internet. Below are a few examples of use cases: Supply Chain - In supply chain there will be multiple blockchains being used at various steps of the process much like there is today with traditional software stacks. The Blocknet Protocol and XRouter would allow information to be accessible between these different blockchains. For Example, pharmaceutical manufacturers have strict regulations to follow and need to provide certain information and assurances. Being able to access batch information from the raw materials being consumed, temperature and humidity information during transportation, and final destinations are all important. A smart contract utilizing XRouter to gather this information from each respective chain and write it to the pharmaceutical\u2019s blockchain along with the batch code. XRouter would enable this communication to occur in a trustless way, which is important to ensure validity of the information. Storage and Hosting - If creating a dApp on Ethereum, you may require storage functionality. Ethereum doesn\u2019t intrinsically handle file storage very efficiently. In this scenario, XRouter can be used to interact with other blockchains such as Storj, Filecoin, Sia, or Swarm to utilize their storage services. Media and Content - For content creation, a creator has the option of publishing to the LBRY Credits or Alexandria blockchains. Similar to HootSuite, which is a tool that allows posting to multiple social media platforms simultaneously, a dApp can be created using XRouter that offers the same benefit. The user can post their content once, whether it\u2019s audio, video, literature, or art, and have it published to Alexandria\u2019s and LBRY Credit\u2019s blockchain platform simultaneously. Markets - There are many blockchains creating decentralized marketplaces including Origami, District0x, OpenBazaar, and Syscoin\u2019s marketplace, but the offering of products are relatively low on each independent platform. A dApp that utilizes XRouter to aggregate all the products into a single hub would offer a lot more options to users and a fuller marketplace. It can also make publishing products easier by publishing to all platforms simultaneously through a single form, offering more exposure than posting to a single marketplace while saving time. Business and Industry - There are many dApps and blockchains that will end up using health data. Rather than submitting health data to each application, a universal EHR (Electronic Health Record) blockchain can be created to manage personal medical data and accessibility of data by each application. The health data on this EHR ledger can be shared amongst healthcare providers, hospitals, and insurance blockchains, dApps, and applications via XRouter. Certifications - Certifications and licensing records can be stored on a dedicated blockchain where they could be verified by a dApp built on the Blocknet Protocol. These records can be used to confirm qualifications and grant access or permissions. // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = []; Related Links \u00b6 var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

A smart contract utilizing XRouter to gather this information from each respective chain and write it to the pharmaceutical\u2019s blockchain along with the batch code. XRouter would enable this communication to occur in a trustless way, which is important to ensure validity of the information. Storage and Hosting - If creating a dApp on Ethereum, you may require storage functionality. Ethereum doesn\u2019t intrinsically handle file storage very efficiently. In this scenario, XRouter can be used to interact with other blockchains such as Storj, Filecoin, Sia, or Swarm to utilize their storage services. Media and Content - For content creation, a creator has the option of publishing to the LBRY Credits or Alexandria blockchains. Similar to HootSuite, which is a tool that allows posting to multiple social media platforms simultaneously, a dApp can be created using XRouter that offers the same benefit. The user can post their content once, whether it\u2019s audio, video, literature, or art, and have it published to Alexandria\u2019s and LBRY Credit\u2019s blockchain platform simultaneously. Markets - There are many blockchains creating decentralized marketplaces including Origami, District0x, OpenBazaar, and Syscoin\u2019s marketplace, but the offering of products are relatively low on each independent platform. A dApp that utilizes XRouter to aggregate all the products into a single hub would offer a lot more options to users and a fuller marketplace. It can also make publishing products easier by publishing to all platforms simultaneously through a single form, offering more exposure than posting to a single marketplace while saving time. Business and Industry - There are many dApps and blockchains that will end up using health data. Rather than submitting health data to each application, a universal EHR (Electronic Health Record) blockchain can be created to manage personal medical data and accessibility of data by each application. The health data on this EHR ledger can be shared amongst healthcare providers, hospitals, and insurance blockchains, dApps, and applications via XRouter. Certifications - Certifications and licensing records can be stored on a dedicated blockchain where they could be verified by a dApp built on the Blocknet Protocol. These records can be used to confirm qualifications and grant access or permissions. // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = [];","title":"Use Cases"},{"location":"protocol/xrouter/introduction/#related-links","text":"var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

Addresses are used similar to bank account routing and checking numbers to tell the network where to send and receive funds during transactions. The address by default is a 34 character alphanumeric string, but an alias can also be created as a more user-friendly naming preference to refer to the wallet's default address. Within each address there can exist multiple UTXOs , also called Inputs . B \u00b6 SCA \u00b6 SCA is the utility token for the Scalaris network. Unlike USD where the smallest denomination is $0.01, the smallest incremental unit of SCA is 0.00000001 SCA. Blockchain Block \u00b6 A block is a record of transaction data in a set period of time ( block time ). A time-series collection of the blocks makes up the blockchain (a chain of blocks). Blockchain \u00b6 A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks , which are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. Scalaris DX \u00b6 Scalaris DX is a decentralized exchange dApp built with the Blocknet Protocol to showcase what can be built using it. Scalaris \u00b6 Scalaris is a self-funded and self-governed open source project with contributors around the world building an open and collaborative ecosystem with the development of the Blocknet Protocol . Blocknet Protocol \u00b6 The Blocknet Protocol is a blockchain interoperablity protocol that consists of 3 components: XBridge , XRouter , and XCloud . Block Reward \u00b6 A block reward is a reward you earn when staking for helping secure the network. Block Time \u00b6 Block time defines the time it takes to mine a block . In all blockchains there is an expected block time. In Scalaris , the expected block time is 1 minute. C \u00b6 Change Address \u00b6 A change address is the address where the remaining funds from an input (a.k.a. UTXO ) are returned after making a transaction. This is always an address you own. If you have an input that's 15 SCA used in a transaction sending 10 SCA, then the remaining 5 SCA will be returned to the change address. This is a similar concept to paying for an item in cash and receiving change back. Client \u00b6 Depending on the context, client refers either to hardware running the Scalaris blockchain or software utilizing the Blocknet Protocol, which can be a blockchain, microservice, dApp, mobile app, website, etc. Coin \u00b6 Coin and token refers to digital assets . Coin Control \u00b6 Coin Control enables the ability to break up or combine inputs . This is comparable to going to a bank and exchanging a bunch of smaller bills for a $50 bill or breaking a larger bills for smaller denominations. Using Coin Control you can also choose to select specific inputs, addresses, and change addresses to use for transactions. Confirmation \u00b6 When transactions are made, the transactions must go through a confirmation process, which validates the transaction to make sure it is authentic. Funds that are being confirmed cannot be used until 60 confirmations (about 60 minutes). D \u00b6 Decentralized Exchange \u00b6 Decentralized exchange is the process exchanging funds between 2 parties with no middlemen. This requires the four core functions of an exchange to be decentralized: storage of funds, order books, order matching, and settlement. DEX \u00b6 DEX is a short-hand acronym for a decentralized exchange . Digital Asset \u00b6 A digital asset is new asset class that describes digital cryptographic coins and tokens. These coins and tokens can represent monetary characteristics (cryptocurrency), digital or virtual goods (unique tokenized items, such as music or art), and ownership (tokenized shares, such as of land or a company). E \u00b6 Encrypted \u00b6 Encrypting your wallet adds an additional level of security. An encrypted wallet requires a passphrase set by the user to spend funds the wallet. F \u00b6 Funds \u00b6 Funds refers to your digital assets . I \u00b6 Input \u00b6 Within a users wallet , the total balance is composed of either one large input or various smaller inputs . Think of an input as bills in a wallet. You can have $100 in your wallet, but that may be composed of a single $100 bill, 5 $20 bills, etc. An input is sometimes also referred to as a UTXO . Interchain Communication \u00b6 Interchain communication is the ability for different blockchains to interact and communicate with each other. For example, one blockchain can write their latest block hashes to the Bitcoin blockchain and also call the data to add extra verification and security. Interoperability \u00b6 Blockchain interoperability is the ability for different blockchains to operate, interact, and communicate with one another. Interoperability comes in two parts: exchange and communication . L \u00b6 Locked \u00b6 By having the wallet locked , funds cannot be sent and staking cannot be enabled. Unlocking the wallet, by entering in the passphrase(created when encrypting the wallet), is required to send funds and also allows staking to be enabled. The wallet can also be partially unlocked, which allows just for staking to be enabled, but does not allow the user to send funds. Lite Wallet \u00b6 A lite wallet is a wallet that does not require the full blockchain in order to function. It instead uses an external data source to provide SPV functionality. M \u00b6 Mint \u00b6 Minting is the process of generating new digital assets on a blockchain that did not exist in any previous blocks . Multiwallet \u00b6 A multiwallet is a wallet that can store multiple types of digital assets . N \u00b6 Naked Node \u00b6 A naked node is a Service Node that does not run any xwallets . Network \u00b6 Network refers to the collection of peers and data on the blockchain. Non-custodial \u00b6 Non-custodial means the user has 100% control of their funds . A third party has no control over it and cannot gain control if they wanted to. O \u00b6 Open Source \u00b6 Open source is used to describe software for which the source code is made freely available for contribution, redistributed, and modification. P \u00b6 Peers \u00b6 Peers are other wallets that you are connected to that help confirm transactions and share updated blocks and data between. When the wallet is not in sync, the wallet is brought up-to-date by syncing with information from peers. Proof-of-Stake \u00b6 Proof-of-stake , also known as PoS, is a type of algorithm by which a blockchain network achieves distributed consensus. Proposals \u00b6 Proposal are suggested plans for consideration. Each Superblock period, new proposals are submitted and Service Nodes vote on these proposals. Proposals can also be used to request funding for contributions to the Blocknet ecosystem. R \u00b6 Reward \u00b6 A reward refers to a payment earned for providing a service. S \u00b6 Service Node \u00b6 Service Nodes provide services to the Blocknet network . They are users that own 2500 SCA and have a certain setup outside of the wallet that allows them the ability to earn rewards for these service and grants them the ability to vote on proposals . Snode \u00b6 Snode is a short-hand term to refer to a Service Node . SPV \u00b6 SPV is an acronym that stands for Simplified Payment Verification. It is a method for verifying if particular transactions are included in a block without downloading the entire block. Staking \u00b6 Staking is used to secure the network by confirming blocks . Users that stake earn rewards. The reward can be referred to as a stake . When users earn a staking reward, it is tied to a specific input in the user's wallet. For a user to stake, the option must be enabled. Superblock \u00b6 A Superblock refers to a specific block that occurs roughly once a month. The Superblock block finalizes the votes on any active proposals and makes funding payouts for any passing proposals. Syncing \u00b6 In order to make transactions or stake , the wallet needs to be up-to-date with the latest blockchain data. When a wallet is Out of Sync , it is not up-to-date. Alternatively, the wallet being synced means it is up-to-date. T \u00b6 Token \u00b6 Token and coin refers to digital assets . Transaction \u00b6 A transaction, similar to a bank transaction, is the process of transferring funds from one account to another.. U \u00b6 Unocked \u00b6 By having the wallet locked , funds cannot be sent and staking cannot be enabled. Unlocking the wallet, by entering in the passphrase(created when encrypting the wallet), is required to send funds and also allows staking to be enabled. The wallet can also be partially unlocked, which allows just for staking to be enabled, but does not allow the user to send funds. User \u00b6 Refers to someone whom has a the wallet program installed on their computer. This may sometimes also be referred to as a peer . UTXO \u00b6 UTXO stands for Unspent Transaction Output . Within a user's wallet , the total balance is composed of either one large UTXO or various smaller UTXOs. Think of a UTXO as bills in a wallet. You can have $100 in your wallet, but that may be composed of a single $100 bill, 5 $20 bills, etc. A UTXO is sometimes also referred to as an input . V \u00b6 Voting \u00b6 Voting is performed by Service Nodes to voice approval/disapproval of proposals . W \u00b6 Wallet \u00b6 A wallet is used to hold you funds of digital assets . This is the digital version of your physical wallet that holds physical money, very much like how your bank account works. Every wallet has one or more associated Addresses and each wallet address can contain multiple UTXOs , , also called Inputs . X \u00b6 XBridge \u00b6 The decentralized exchange component of the Blocknet Protocol . XCloud \u00b6 The decentralized cloud component of the Blocknet Protocol . XRouter \u00b6 The interchain communication component of the Blocknet Protocol . XWallets \u00b6 XWallets refers to the full node wallets hosted by Service Nodes . // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = []; Related Links \u00b6 var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

For any questions not answered below, please join the Scalaris community on Discord for further discussion: Discord Invite or Telegram My version of [blockchain] wallet isn\u2019t one of the options to select in the set up process. Can I use this version? Will it still work?\" Only use wallet versions that are listed. If a version is not listed, it has either not been tested yet or is not compatible. Using a wallet version not listed may result in failed trades or loss of funds. I have Scalaris DX currently working with two wallets. I want to add a third blockchain wallet. Do I need to restart all wallets and go through the set up process again?\" Yes, at this point in time the setup process needs to be repeated to add additional wallets. However, the blockchains previously selected will be remembered at the initial selection screen when repeating the setup process. The option to go through the setup process again can be found in the sidebar menu under the \u2018Settings\u2019 section. I am trading with SCA/LTC. If I make an order with BUY, does that mean I want to buy SCA (and sell LTC)? If I select \u201cSELL,\u201d that means I am selling SCA and will receive LTC?\" If in the SCA/LTC market and using BUY order form, you will be buying SCA with LTC. Using the SELL order form means you will be selling SCA to receive LTC. Do I always need to download and use full blockchains when trading?\" Scalaris DX is a full decentralized exchange with no central components, which requires the full blockchains to be installed and synced locally to submit the trades as transactions on the network. Do I need to have SCA in order to trade?\" If you are making (placing) an order, no SCA is needed. If you are taking (filling) an order, SCA is need to cover the trade fee. Read more... If I want to place or accept multiple trades, I need to split my tokens into multiple UTXOs within the same address. How do I do that?\" Splitting of tokens (inputs) can be done using the Coin Control functionality within the respective wallet. I keep getting change addresses after making trades. How do I consolidate them all back into one address and then split them back up into multiple UTXOs again?\" Combining and splitting of tokens (inputs) can be done using the Coin Control functionality within the respective wallet. Why is my balance shown as 0 even though I have funds in it.\" Some blockchains have Segwit enabled, which uses a different address system. At the moment these new Segwit addresses are not supported so legacy addresses must be used. For example, with Litecoin \u2018L\u2019 addresses should be used instead of \u2018M\u2019 addresses and with Monacoin \u2018M\u2019 addresses should be used instead of \u2018P\u2019 addresses. Why is my balance on Scalaris DX different than in my wallet?\" The balance reported in Scalaris DX may be less than the amount reported in the respective wallet because the Scalaris DX reports the available balance. This is the balance showing in your wallet minus any immature funds (such as from staking) and funds locked up in open trades + try add staking=0 to conf if it's pos coin ( as exmaple at scalaris for stop staking) , or what need use at your coin. Why is market pricing showing as \u2018N/A\u2019?\" If the alternate market pricing is shown as \u2018N/A\u2019, this means that the current API source selected does not support the current market. When this happens, another API source should be selected. // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = []; Related Links \u00b6 var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

Unlike centralized exchanges, Scalaris DX has no deposit, withdrawal, or maker fees other than network fees of the asset being traded. Maker Fee \u00b6 When creating an order on Scalaris DX, there is no fee other than the transaction fee for the network of the asset being sold. This is the same type of fee you would incur if sending this asset to another party. Having no fee to place an order encourages market makers to add liquidity. This also makes it possible for a user to acquire the SCA needed to take orders. Taker Fee \u00b6 When accepting an order on Scalaris DX, a static fee of 0.01 SCA is charged at the time the order is taken. This fee is charged even if a trade is canceled or fails and is meant to discourage malicious behavior on the network. In addition to the 0.01 SCA fee, there is also the transaction fee for the network of the asset being sold. This is the same type of fee you would incur if sending this asset to another party. If the taker asset is SCA, there needs to be at least two UTXOs - one or more to cover the 0.01 SCA fee and one or more to cover the traded amount. In a future update, there will be a percent-based fee that\u2019s charged when accepting an order, but the details of this are not yet finalized.

Zero Downtime - Since Scalaris DX is a decentralized exchange powered by the Blocknet Protocol, there is zero downtime and built-in DoS protection. What are Decentralized Exchanges \u00b6 A decentralized exchange is a service enabling counterparties (traders) to exchange one asset for another, without the involvement of any third party as an intermediary. This applies to all components of an exchange (not just settlement), which is the only criteria many 'decentralized' exchanges use to classify themselves as such (i.e. using atomic swaps). The term \"decentralized\" refers to matters of control rather than the distribution of processing. The ideal of a decentralized solution is one where no third party is required to act on their behalf in order for a trade to take place. To make an exchange truly decentralized, the following is needed: Decentralized storage of funds Decentralized order books Decentralized order matching Decentralized settlement Decentralized governance Decentralized development (open source) What Aren\u2019t Decentralized Exchanges \u00b6 As stated above, many so-called \u201cdecentralized\u201d exchanges claim to be so because they use atomic swaps for settlement. Since there are more components to an exchange than settlement, (including storage of funds, order books, and order matching) most of these exchanges would more accurately be described as hybrid exchanges since not all of these components are decentralized. An easy way to tell if an exchange has centralized components is if any of the following are true: Requires signup or a login Requires sending funds to another address No control of private keys The development team is able to help out with stuck transactions, deposit/withdrawal issues, etc Derivatives (proxy tokens or colored coins) are used as an intermediary in the exchange // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = []; Related Links \u00b6 var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

If you would like to have a digital asset listed, the first step is to confirm the asset meets the following requirements. If it doesn't currently meet all these requirements, please work with the developers of the project/asset to ensure they are all met. If you have questions about any of these requirements, please join Scalaris Discord Server or join Scalaris Telegram and ask your questions in the #scalaris-dx-listing channel. Requirements \u00b6 In order for for a blockchain to be compatible it must support JSON RPC, CLTV atomic swaps, and the following calls: createrawtransaction decoderawtransaction getblock getblockchaininfo (fallback getnetworkinfo, getinfo) getblockhash getnewaddress getrawmempool getrawtransaction gettransaction gettxout listunspent sendrawtransaction signmessage signrawtransaction (or signrawtransactionwithwallet) verifymessage Requirements Met \u00b6 When all of the above requirements are met, you are ready to proceed to the next step in listing your asset. At this point, you basically have two options: Option 1. Do it yourself. This option is 100% free. It could be for you if... You are comfortable working with Git Fork-and-Branch workflow. You are comfortable editing JSON format files like this and creating configuration files like this . You can Thoroughly test your asset in ScalarisDX, and that requires a Service Node to host your asset's native wallet. The easiest way to have a Service Node host your asset's wallet is to own your own Service Node and host it yourself. However, if it's not feasible for you to run your own Service Node, you can probably find someone in the Scalaris Community who will host your asset on their Service Node at a very reasonable rate. (If you get lucky, or if your asset is expected to have high trade volume, you might even find someone to host it for free.) To look for someone to host your asset on their Service Node, join Scalaris Discord Server or join Scalaris Telegram and ask around in the #scalaris-dx-listing channel. If you can meet criteria 1, 2 & 3 above, use Git Fork-and-Branch workflow to: Create an XBridge Config. file for your asset in the directory, xbridge-confs . Create a Wallet Config. file for your asset in the directory, wallet-confs . Add an object for your asset in the file, manifest-latest.json . Add an object for your asset in the file, manifest.json . (This file is actually identical to manifest-latest.json ; it may be eliminated someday.) The README.md in the blockchain-configuration-files directory contains full details on how to create & edit these files. It also contains detailed instructions for Testing a Blockchain for Compatibility , which you should be sure to follow before submitting a Pull Request to have your listing merged into the master branch of the Github repository. Tip: you may save some time by identifying an already listed asset which is closely related to your asset, then copying/pasting/modifying from that asset. Tip: How to determine config values for MinTxFee & FeePerByte in XBridge Config. file. MinTxFee & FeePerByte are two values set in an asset's XBridge Config. file which are sometimes confusing to people. MinTxFee can be used to set a minimum transaction fee, but most of the time it works best to keep this value set to 0 and instead adjust the value of FeePerByte . FeePerByte is how much to charge per byte for an exchange. This can be calculated by looking in the wallet send function for the recommended fee per byte and then multiplying it by 2-2.5 since there are 2 transactions that occur in an exchange: one transaction from one party's address to the P2SH address and then a second transaction from the P2SH address to the counterparty's address. This is one of the reasons why test trades are needed. Option 2. Contract a member of the Scalaris Community to do it for you. This option is obviously not 100% free, but there are Scalaris Community members who are willing to do the work of listing & testing your asset, and also willing to host your asset on their Service Node at very reasonable rates.

Follow the guides below to learn how to check your balances, select your market, make orders, take orders, check order status, and view order history. If Scalaris DX has not been setup yet, please follow the setup guide . Balances The first thing you want to do when starting Scalaris DX is to check your balances. Balances displays the connected wallets along with the available balance. A connected wallet is one that has been configured and is currently open and unlocked. The available balance is the balance of the funds in a wallet that are not locked up. The Available balance may show a value different than what's displayed in the wallet if: The wallet is locked. You have already made a trade that has locked up funds. You will want to create smaller inputs so that a single trade won't lock up more funds than needed. Funds aren't in a legacy address. Right now only legacy addresses are compatible. If you are using a Segwit address, please create a new address to send the funds to. If the wallet has been configured via Scalaris DX, then a legacy address will automatically be created when generating a new address. The wallet was not configured . The wallet was not restarted after the configuration. If inputs have been locked via Coin Control. Select Market The market selection tool can be found in the upper-left corned. Click the Select market pair button. A downdown will appear with two lists: the assets of the wallets you have connected and all assets listed on Scalaris DX. From Connected Tokens , select the asset you would like to trade. Select the asset you would like to trade the first asset with. The first asset will be priced in terms of this asset. This asset must have a wallet configured. Select Select to view the chosen market. Market Information Warning: When opening ScalarisDX for the first time it can take up to 3 minutes for all currently active orders to display on the screen. This is simply the nature of a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer network. If your XBridge client is connected to very few peers, it can even take slightly longer than 3 minutes. Hint: Check your peer count. Redesign Wallet: Within ScalarisDX, each market has a price chart, depth chart, and market stats available. The market stats are above the price chart and show the last trade price, percent in price change over the last 24 hour rolling period, and volume over the last 24 hour rolling period. The chart has the ability to zoom. To zoom in, click and drag the pointer over the are you want to zoom in on. You can hover over the candles to show the information of each data point in the legend. To reset the chart, select the Show All button in the upper-right corner of the chart. To the right of the price chart there's also a depth chart. The depth chart shows how much market depth there is of orders at certain prices. Hover order the depth chart to view the data values. Make Order Review the trading fees for making orders. At the left side of Scalaris DX you will find an order form. Select either the buy or sell tab. For Amount (the first input), enter the amount you would like to buy or sell. Note: There are no limit, market, or partial orders. At the moment there are just *Exact* orders, meaning that orders must be taken for the exact amounts. Due to this setup, if trading a large amount it may be best to instead break the order into a few smaller separate orders. For Price (the second input), enter the price (rate) for which you would like to trade the first asset. Note, there is also an option to enter Price in terms of BTC. Total shows the total amount of the 2nd asset that will be traded for the first asset. In the Address fields, enter the addresses the funds will be going to for each asset. In the above example, buying SCA with BTC, the SCA Address is the address where the SCA you buy will be sent, and the BTC Address is the change address where BTC change from the transaction will be sent. If you don't mind having funds sent to new/empty addresses in your SCA and BTC wallets, you can just click the Generate New SCA/BTC Address options to fill in both of these Address fields automatically. However, if you want the asset you're acquiring or the change from the transaction to go to specific addresses in your wallet, you'll need to copy/paste those specific addresses from your wallets into these fields. (For now, these Address fields must be legacy addresses, not Segwit addresses.) Note, the address from which the trade is funded is chosen automatically by ScalarisDX. ScalarisDX funds the trade from the address with the smallest UTXO which can cover the expense of the trade. Ignore Order ID , that should be blank when creating an order. Review your order. Select the place order button. The trade will now be visible as Open under Active Orders . The Scalaris wallet and the wallets that are being traded out of must remain open and unlocked during trading. If the Scalaris wallet is closed, any open orders will automatically be cancelled. Take Order Review the trading fees for taking orders. On the right side of Scalaris DX you will find the order book. Click on the order you would like to take. Note: There are no limit, market, or partial orders. At the moment there are just *Exact* orders, meaning that orders must be taken for the exact amounts. Due to this setup, you must have enough funds to cover the entire sell amount of the order selected. The order form on the left side of Scalaris DX will auto-populate. Make sure Balances shows enough funds in the Available column to cover the order. In the Address fields, enter the addresses the funds will be going to for each asset. In the above example, selling SCA for BTC, the SCA Address is the change address where SCA change from the transaction will be sent, and the BTC Address is the address where the BTC you acquire from the sale will be sent. If you don't mind having funds sent to new/empty addresses in your SCA and BTC wallets, you can just click the Generate New SCA/BTC Address options to fill in both of these Address fields automatically.

ScalarisDX funds the trade from the address with the smallest UTXO which can cover the expense of the trade. Review your order. Select the place order button. The trade will now be visible under Active Orders . The trade should complete in about 20-30 seconds. The Scalaris wallet and the wallets that are being traded out of must remain open and unlocked during trading. If the Scalaris wallet is closed, any open orders will automatically be cancelled. Order Status Any orders that are open or in progress can be found in Active Orders . You can hover over the order to read the order state. Any orders that are cancelled, completed, or failed can be found in Inactive Orders Again, you can hover over the order to read the order state. There are different icons to represent each order state. If you have created an order, it will be indicated in the order book with a white dot. The Scalaris wallet and the wallets that are being traded out of must remain open and unlocked during trading. If the Scalaris wallet is closed, any open orders will automatically be cancelled. Order History At the bottom-right corner of Scalaris DX you can find the trade history. The trade history information is gathered only for the wallets that are configured. Therefore, the trade history will only show the orders that have been completed since Scalaris wallet and wallets for the currently viewed market have been opened and unlocked. If the Scalaris wallet is restarted, this information will be cleared and no longer visible. // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = []; Related Links \u00b6 var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

These Service Nodes are used as a DHT network overlay to support XBridge , XRouter , and XCloud services. In order to support these services, they host full nodes of the blockchains the protocol is compatible with, serve oracle data, verify UTXOs, route communication between blockchains, and perform anti-spam and anti-DOS measures for the network. Service Nodes can also vote to participate in Scalaris's self-governance system . Service Nodes require 2500 SCA . If seeking to acquire SCA, there are various options available . Operating a Service Node should be viewed as a business since the amount of revenue you generate is completely in your control. You can choose to provide as many services as you'd like. The more services you offer and the higher the quality service you provide, the greater the revenue you will be able to produce. You can also invest in your services by advertising them to developers and selling those services to them. You can develop relationships with developers and gather feedback on the type of services that they would find the most valuable and then capitalize on that by offering those services. For XBridge services, the fees for trades are currently set at a static 0.01 SCA taker fee per trade and are paid out to a random Service Node that supports both of the chains that the trade took place between. In a future update, these fees will be set to a percent of the trade for the taker. For XRouter and XCloud services, it's a free market model where you are able to specify the amount you want to charge for each call and users get to specify the maximum fee they are willing to pay. The more useful and/or computationally expensive the call, the more valuable it is to the user, and the more you can charge. XCloud service can vary widely and not everything requires coding. For instance, you can setup a plugin file that allows you to offer CoinMarketCap pricing info via your Service Node for developers to use on-chain. You can set this up in a minute without any programming. This is just one example of an extremely useful service for developers. Not only do they want access to this data, but offering it through Scalaris allows them to pay in crypto, which is much simpler than needing to deal with fiat payments paid via on-chain functions.

For instructions on setting up a Service Node, see the Service Node Setup Guide . Service Node Staking \u00b6 To stake your Service Node collateral, you can enable staking as you normally would. The inputs used for your Service Node collateral are all tracked, so when you \"hit\" a stake and it generates a new input it will auto-register for you to keep the Service Node active. After a stake, the Service Node is still active for all existing clients, but will be inactive for new clients until the 2 confirmations are complete. Note : If you register the Service Node from a collateral wallet then import the Service Node's SCA address to another machine for staking, the Service Node will go offline. Make sure you register the Service Node ( servicenoderegister ) from the machine that will be staking so that it will know to auto-register on stake. Check Service Node Status \u00b6 On the SNode wallet you can use servicenodestatus . On the Collateral wallet you can use servicenodelist . If you're using the command line you can filter the list with scalaris-cli servicenode list | sed -n '/\"snodekey\": \"#####/,/},/p' , replacing ##### with your Service Node's snodekey. Example: ./scalaris-cli servicenode list | sed -n '/\"snodekey\": \"\\(0b38bfac90cc5c683b6a27f952b2346a1009fc0f9c1a0790809f185ab27b14ecc6\\)/,/},/p You can also filter for multiple Service Nodes by separating each snodekey with \\| . Example: ./scalaris-cli servicenode list | sed -n '/\"snodekey\": \"\\(#####\\|#####\\|#####\\)/,/},/p Updated Your Scalaris Wallets \u00b6 If you have just updated your Collateral Computer wallet and SNode Computer wallet, follow these instructions: Open the Collateral Computer wallet and let it sync. Open the SNode Computer wallet and let it sync. From the Collateral Computer wallet, re-register the node with the servicenoderegister command. From the SNode Computer wallet, send the network ping with servicenodesendping . Restarted Your SNode Computer Wallet \u00b6 If you have just restarted your SNode Computer wallet, follow these instructions: Open the SNode Computer wallet and let it sync. From the SNode Computer, check if your Service Nodes status still shows \"running\" with the servicenodestatus command. If they show \"status\": \"running\" then you don't need to do anything. If they show \"offline\" then continue. From the Collateral Computer wallet, re-register the node with the servicenoderegister command. From the SNode Computer wallet, send the network ping with servicenodesendping . Restarted Your Collateral Computer Wallet \u00b6 If you have just restarted your Collateral Computer wallet you don't need to do anything. Updated Your SNode Computer scalaris.conf \u00b6 If you have just updated the scalaris.conf on your SNode Computer wallet, follow these instructions: Restart the SNode Computer wallet and let it sync. Open the Collateral Computer wallet and let it sync. From the SNode Computer, check if your Service Nodes status still shows \"running\" with the servicenodestatus command. If they show \"status\": \"running\" then you don't need to do anything. If they show \"offline\" then continue. From the Collateral Computer wallet, re-register the node with the servicenoderegister command. From the SNode Computer wallet, send the network ping with servicenodesendping . Updated Your SNode Computer xbridge.conf \u00b6 If you have just updated the xbridge.conf on your SNode Computer wallet, follow these instructions: Add the blockchains you want to add trading support for in the ExchangeWallets= entry in xbridge.conf , denoted by the chain's asset's ticker. Separate each wallet name with a comma (no space). You can keep the rest of the configuration body the same, only the ExchangeWallets= setting needs to be updated (unless adding new support). Example: ExchangeWallets=SCA,LTC,BTC,SYS,DGB Restart the Scalaris wallet or use the dxLoadXBridgeConf command (from either the Debug Console or the command line) to load the updated settings. Use servicenodesendping to propogate these new settings to the network immediately or wait up to 3 minutes for this to happen automatically. You can view the blockchains you are supporting with the dxGetLocalTokens command. Updated XRouter Services or Configs \u00b6 If you have just updated the xrouter.conf on your SNode Computer wallet, follow these instructions: Add the chains you want to support SPV calls for in the wallets= entry in xrouter.conf , denoted by the chain's asset's ticker. Separate each wallet name with a comma. Example: wallets=SYS,SCA,BTC,ETH,MNP If you added or removed blockchain support, make sure to also update the rpcthreads= value in the scalaris.conf file. Use xrReloadConfigs to load your newly configured settings to xrouter.conf without needing to restart your Service Node. Use servicenodesendping to propogate these new settings to the network immediately or wait up to 3 minutes for this to happen automatically. You can view your configs using xrStatus . Updated XCloud Services or Plugin Files \u00b6 If you have just updated your XCloud services or plugin files, follow these instructions: Add the service name to the plugins= entry in xrouter.conf . The service name listed must be the exact name of your config file without the file extension. Separate each service name with a comma. Example: If you had 3 services that you wanted to deploy with config names eth_getBalance.conf , eth_blockNumber.conf , and weatherData.conf , the plugins= setting would read as follows: plugins=eth_getBalance,eth_blockNumber,weatherData Use xrReloadConfigs to load your newly configured settings to xrouter.conf without needing to restart your Service Node. Use servicenodesendping to propogate these new settings to the network immediately or wait up to 3 minutes for this to happen automatically. You can view your configs using xrStatus ( See example output ). Post your services to Discord channel #Services so others can discover, learn more, and find instructions on how to interact with your service. View Your XRouter or XCloud Configs \u00b6 You can view your configs using xrStatus . This returns your SPV wallets, SPV calls and settings, plugin calls and settings, and the raw text of your xrouter.conf file.

Operating a Service Node requires 2500 SCA collateral. This 2500 SCA collateral will still be in your wallet and in your control, but must not be moved or spent in order for the Service Node to remain valid and active. However, you may still use this collateral to participate in staking. Operating as a Service Node requires two computers: Collateral Computer - The computer will contain the 2500 SCA collateral and does NOT need to remain on with the wallet open unless the 2500 SCA is being staked or you are voting on a proposal . SNode Server Computer - This computer will act as the Service Node and must remain on with the wallet open. To setup your Service Node, complete the following guides in order: Collateral Computer Setup SNode Server Computer Setup Additional Setup Service Node Deployment Collateral Computer Setup \u00b6 Setup using wallet Install the Scalaris wallet . Fully sync the wallet . Encrypt the wallet . Note If your SCA funds are located on a different wallet, you will need to first send the 2500 SCA to this collateral Scalaris wallet. Make sure to include a little extra (1 SCA) to have enough to cover transaction fees when continuing this step. Select Tools from the left menu, then the Debug Console tab. The input field at the bottom is where you will type commands. Create a new public address for the Service Node. A unique name for this address will need to be provided as an alias. To do this, type getnewaddress [ALIAS] into the debug console with [ALIAS] replaced with the alias you will be using for this address. Example: getnewaddress snode1 Press the Enter or Return key. The command will appear in the console window followed by a response with the created address. Retrieve your private key for the newly created address for backup purposes. Type dumpprivkey [ADDRESS] using the new address and press the Enter or Return key. Example: dumpprivkey SZ6CHFUomGnuZxm18EQUvTstxxujJZbk1Q Warning DO NOT share your private keys with others or keep them stored somewhere where others can't find them. Sharing your private keys may result in LOSS OF FUNDS . Create the input(s) needed for the Service Node collateral using the following command structure ( Note: If you already have your inputs created for your Service Node(s) you can skip this step and the next step): servicenodecreateinputs [NODE_ADDRESS] [NODE_COUNT] [INPUT_SIZE] NODE_COUNT = The number of Service Nodes to create. NODE_ADDRESS = The address returned in the previous step. Requires a minimum of 2501 SCA per Service Node (1 SCA extra for transaction fee). * If left blank, it defaults to 1 . * Example: 10,001 SCA will be needed to create 4 Service Nodes INPUT_SIZE = The amount of SCA for each collateral input.

Restart the Scalaris wallet. Additional Configuration \u00b6 At this point you have completed the basic setup for a Service Node. The Service Node can operate but will not be supporting any service. Now what you need to do is setup the Service Node to support services on the network where 100% of fees are distributed to Service Nodes: With XBridge , the decentralized exchange component of the Blocknet Protocol, 100% of trading fees are distributed to Service Nodes for hosting full blockchain nodes and providing verification checks for trustless exchange between digital assets. For setup, see the XBridge Configuration Guide . With XRouter **, the decentralized inter-chain communication component of the Blocknet Protocol, 100% of fees are paid to Service Nodes for hosting full blockchain nodes that support SPV calls. For setup, see the XRouter Configuration Guide . With XCloud **, a decentralized microservice oracle network built on XRouter, allows you to monetize any microservice, blockchain call, API, or cloud tech on your own hardware, in many cases without having to write any code. For setup, see the XCloud Configuration Guide . ** For XRouter and XCloud services , your Service Node Computer IP address must remain unchanged (static). If using a VPN with an IP that changes, it will impact your ability to provide these services. Deploying Service Node \u00b6 Setup using wallet Preparation On the SNode Server computer: Start the Scalaris wallet (or restart if you haven't already or have made changes). Make sure this contains the previously configured scalaris.conf file and the servicenode.conf with the Service Node credentials. Fully sync the wallet. This wallet must stay running. If the SNode Server wallet is closed, you will need to re-register the Service Node from the Collateral Computer wallet if you have staked a block in that time period. On the Collateral computer: Start the Scalaris wallet (or restart if you haven't already or have made changes). Fully sync the wallet. Register the Service Node Make sure all your inputs have at least 2 confirmations (about 2 minutes since servicenodecreateinputs ). On the Collateral Computer wallet, open the debug console and type servicenoderegister [ALIAS] with [ALIAS] replaced with the alias of the Service Node you want to register. If [ALIAS] isn't specified, all known Service Nodes will be registered. You will see a response similar to this: The snodekey will remain unchanged as long as the contents of your servicenode.conf remains unchanged and you haven't used the servicenodesetup command. Send Service Node Ping to the Network On the SNode Server wallet, open the debug console and type servicenodesendping . You should see that the Service Node status is now \"status\": \"running\" along with a list of the services being hosted. Check Service Node Status On the SNode Server wallet, open the debug console and type servicenodestatus . You should still see a running status and the services being hosted. Check Service Node Is Available on the Network On a client other than the SNode Server wallet (such as the Collateral Computer wallet), open the debug console and type servicenodelist . You should see your newly created Service Node in the returned list with the status as \"status\": \"running\" . Your Service Node is the one with the \"snodekey\" that matches the ones returned when registering your node. At this point the Collateral Computer wallet can be closed if you are not voting or staking. Operation \u00b6 View the Operations for reference on how to go about common Service Node operations such as staking, voting, updating, restarting, and checking your Service Node configs. Troubleshooting \u00b6 Ensure you have the latest wallet and that it's fully synced. Ensure the SNode Computer wallet is open and synced before using the servicenoderegister from the Collateral Computer wallet. Ensure that you have at least 2500 SCA per Service Node in your designated [NODE_ADDRESS] . Ensure that your 2500 SCA accidentally didn\u2019t send to a change address (if creating inputs manually). Ensure all your inputs have at least 2 confirmations before registering. Ensure you didn't include the [ or ] when typing commands and replacing the variables. Example: Correct: getnewaddress snode1 Incorrect: getnewaddress [snode1] If you manually setup your Service Node (this guide shows the automatic procedure): Ensure your servicenode.conf information is correct to your settings. Ensure that the servicenode.conf matches on both the Collateral and SNode Server computers. Ensure your configuration file is servicenode.conf and NOT servicenode.conf.txt .

If you have not yet setup your Service Node, start with the Service Node Setup Guide . XBridge is a decentralized exchange protocol with the ability to perform non-custodial, trustless, and decentralized exchange between any digital assets that is supported by the Blocknet Protocol. XBridge allows any application to perform decentralized exchange, opening the door to an ecosystem of decentralized trading services (see the list of compatible blockchains ). Service Nodes are used to verify that the UTXOs in the trades are valid and relay the order book. For these services, Service Nodes receive 100% of trade fees . For each market you would like to support and earn fees from, you must host the full nodes of those blockchains. For example, if you are hosting full nodes of Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Scalaris, you would be supporting the following markets: BTC-LTC, BTC-SCA, LTC-BTC, LTC-SCA, SCA-BTC, SCA-LTC. Note: Full nodes are required. Lite wallets and Electrum wallets are not supported. You must host full blockchain nodes with txindex=1 . In order to check if you are running a full node, use the getblockchaininfo command. You should see \"pruned\": false, if you are running a full node. If you see \"pruned\": true, then make sure txindex=1 is in that wallet's configureation file and restart the wallet. See the list of compatible blockchains . To setup XBridge, follow these steps: Enable XBridge Configure XBridge Deploy Wallets Enable XBridge \u00b6 XBridge is turned off by default. To turn it on, add enableexchange=1 to scalaris.conf . Changing this to enableexchange=0 will turn off XBridge. Example scalaris.conf : listen=1 server=1 rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 rpcuser=username rpcpassword=password port=42500 rpcport=42510 enableexchange=1 servicenode=1 rpcthreads=8 # equal to number of supported wallets, set to no less than 8 Tip: For best performance... maxconnections= setting should not be specified. rpcthreads= should be set to the number of blockchains you are supporting (if running 24 blockchains, set rpcthreads=24 ). If you are running less than 8 blockchains then it should remain rpcthreads=8 as the minimum. After making these changes you will need to restart your Service Node Scalaris wallet. Configure XBridge \u00b6 To configure XBridge, Scalaris's xbridge.conf file and the wallet configuration files for each supported blockchain must be setup properly. Configuration is specific to the blockchain and wallet version. Here is a list of compatible blockchains and wallet versions . All configuration files can be found in the blockchain-configuration-files Github repo . Scalaris uses a manifest ( view manifest ) to determine which configurations to use based off the blockchain and wallet version. The manifest uses a code-friendly format called JSON. This manifest uses \"version groups\", which is a group of wallet versions for a blockchain that pertain to a specific set of configurations. A blockchain can have multiple version groups, each with different sets of wallet versions. Each version group is separated by {curly brackets} and contains similar sets of information. The information you will need to focus on is the following: Key Example Data (Bitcoin) Description blockchain Bitcoin The name of the blockchain. ticker BTC The blockchain's ticker. ver_name Bitcoin v0.16.x Version group name. versions [\"v0.16.0\",\"v0.16.1\",\"v0.16.2\",\"v0.16.3\"] The wallet versions compatible with this version group. xbridge_conf bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf Filename of XBridge configs for these wallet version. wallet_conf bitcoin--v0.16.0.conf Filename of wallet config for these wallet versions. Wallet Confs \u00b6 In the manifest , find the version group for the blockchain you want to support. For example, if you want to support Bitcoin and have wallet version 0.17.0.1 then find the version group that says \"blockchain\": \"Bitcoin\" and has \"v0.17.0.1\" listed under \"versions\" . Thre are multiple version groups for Bitcoin, but only 1 version group with v0.17.0.1 listed under it: { \"blockchain\": \"Bitcoin\", \"ticker\": \"BTC\", \"ver_id\": \"bitcoin--v0.17.0\", \"ver_name\": \"Bitcoin v0.17.x\", \"conf_name\": \"bitcoin.conf\", \"dir_name_linux\": \"bitcoin\", \"dir_name_mac\": \"Bitcoin\", \"dir_name_win\": \"Bitcoin\", \"repo_url\": \"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin\", \"versions\": [ \"v0.17.0\", \"v0.17.0.1\", \"v0.17.1\" ], \"xbridge_conf\": \"bitcoin--v0.15.1.conf\", \"wallet_conf\": \"bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf\" }, Take a note of the \"wallet_conf\" filename. For Bitcoin v0.17.0.1 it is bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf . Navigate to the wallet-confs/ folder of the blockchain configuration files repo: https://github.com/scalaris-project/blockchain-configuration-files/tree/master/wallet-confs Open the file with the filename listed in the version group. For Bitcoin v0.17.0.1, filename bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf , that would be this file: https://github.com/scalaris-project/blockchain-configuration-files/blob/master/wallet-confs/bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf Copy that file's contents. These are the contents of bitcoin--v0.17.0.conf : server=1 listen=1 rpcuser= rpcpassword= rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 port=8333 rpcport=8332 txindex=1 # Legacy addresses must be used (address must begin with \"1\", not \"3\") addresstype=legacy changetype=legacy # Enable deprecated calls deprecatedrpc=signrawtransaction Open the wallet's configuration file. For Bitcoin this is bitcoin.conf . Delete any contents in this file. This is important because and duplicate settings can mess with the configuration. Paste the previously copied file contents into the wallet's configuration file. Enter a username and password for rpcuser= and rpcpassword= . These should be difficult and secure credentials. Enter the IP of your Service Node client for rpcallowip= . If this blockchain will be hosted on the Service Node computer, use rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 (localhost). Save the configuration file. If the blockchain's wallet has been open, you will ned to restart it to load the updated configurations. Repeat this process for each blockchain you want to support. XBridge Conf \u00b6 In the manifest , find the version group for the blockchain you want to support. For example, if you want to support Bitcoin and have wallet version 0.17.0.1 then find the version group that says \"blockchain\": \"Bitcoin\" and has \"v0.17.0.1\" listed under \"versions\" .

At the beginning of the file, enter the following main settings: [Main] ExchangeWallets= FullLog=true After the [Main] settings, paste the previously copied file contents. Repeat this process and paste in the XBridge configurations for other blockchains. Update each blockchain's Username= , Password= , and Ip= setting with the rpcuser= , rpcpassword= , and rpcallowip= values from the respective wallet conf file. The Address= setting can be left blank. Add the blockchain's ticker to the ExchangeWallets= setting, separating each one with a comma (no spaces). Save the xbridge.conf file.

If you have not yet setup your Service Node, start with the Service Node Setup Guide . Since XCloud is built on XRouter, you must also complete XRouter configuration . Note: XCloud requires a static IP For XCloud services, your Service Node Computer IP address must remain unchanged (static IP). If using a VPN with an IP that changes, it will impact your ability to provide XCloud services. XCloud makes direct connections and you'll need a WAN IP as your Service Node IP address and if it's behind a router you'll need to port-forward to it. XCloud is a decentralized microservice cloud network that allows you to monetize any microservice, blockchain, API, or cloud tech on your own hardware, in many cases without having to write any code. Some examples of these services are blockchain-based calls such as those provided by Infura, one that returns a list of Sacaris marketplace listings, third party data calls such as one that provides access to CMC's API, or a custom call for a service you create yourself. You have the option to offer these services for free or to charge a fee for each call. Fees can be specified individually for each call. To host a service, follow these steps: Find a service you'd like to provide or create a custom one. Create the configuration file Determine the service type Configure the service Deploy service Additional information For these examples we will use Ethereum's eth_getBalance call. Create Configuration File \u00b6 You will need to create a configuration file (.conf) for the service's settings. Each service requires its own configuration file. These files are kept within the plugins folder in the Scalaris wallet data directory. Create the service's configuration file within the plugins folder. Make sure to follow the naming rules: The service name is also the call that is used when interacting with the service. The service name and service filename must be the same. Service filenames must have the .conf file extention. A service name can only use the following characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _, -, and : If the service is a blockchain call not supported in the default SPV commands, such as eth_getBalance for Ethereum, the recommended convention for the service name is [asset ticker]_[native_command-name] with the ticker lowercase (if the ticker isn't already part of the name). E.g. eth_getBalance (call) and eth_getBalance.conf (config file) Here are examples of service names and filenames: Format Service Name Service Filename Reason Correct eth_getBalance eth_getBalance.conf Follows correct convention and the names are equal. Incorrect eth_getBalance eth_getbalance.conf The service name and service filename do not match. Incorrect eth_getBalance eth-getbalance.conf The service name and service filename do not match. Incorrect eth_getBalance ETH_getbalance.conf The asset ticker should be all lowercase. Incorrect getbalanceETH getbalanceETH.conf The asset ticker should be first followed by and underscore then the command. Correct weatherData weatherData.conf Names match and only uses allowed characters. Incorrect weatherData weather-data.conf The service name and service filename do not match. Incorrect weatherData weatherData.txt The filename extension is .txt instead of .conf. Determine Service Type \u00b6 The type of service is determined by how it's interacted with and will need different configurations. Here are the current supported types with explanations on when to use each: rpc - Use if a service is for a blockchain call on a wallet that's not in a container. See RPC Service Setup . docker - Use if you are running your service within a Docker container, whether it's a wallet or any other type of miscroservice. See Docker Service Setup . shell - Unsupported at this time. Configure Service \u00b6 The configuration file has information required to connect with your service, interact with it, and additional settings like fees and request limits. Follow the guide that pertains to your service type . Note: The configuration file has a 2mb size limit. Note: RPC Services also require xbridge.conf configuration. To support SPV calls, you must also have your xbridge.conf file setup for each of the chains you wish to support and those wallets must remain open and running ( view XBridge setup guide ). If you already have this setup for XRouter SPV calls then you don't need to do anything extra unless you want to support additional chains. For ETH, you will also need JSONVersion=2.0 and ContentType=application/json added to the [ETH] entry in xbridge.conf . This applies to GETH and Parity clients. Here is an example service config file: eth_getBalance.conf parameters=string,string fee=0.01 clientrequestlimit=100 private::type=rpc private::rpcip=127.0.0.1 private::rpcport=8370 private::rpcuser=username private::rpcpassword=password private::rpccommand=eth_getBalance #! Equivalent to: parity-cli eth_getBalance [address] [block_parameter] Settings Description parameters Optional. Use this if the call takes parameters. List the value type of each parameter in the order the parameters are used (e.g. parameters: int,string,string,bool ). Supported types are string , bool , double , and int . fee The fee (in SCA) you require for this call. A value of 0 means there is no fee and that the calls are free ( default - see note below). clientrequestlimit The minimum time allowed between calls in milliseconds. A value of -1 means there is no limit ( default - see note below). If client requests exceed this value they will be penalized and eventually banned by your node. fetchlimit The maximum number of blocks processed. The default value is 50 (see note below). A value of -1 means there is no limit. disabled Used to disable a call. A value of 1 means the call is disabled and 0 means the call is enabled ( default - see note below). private::type=rpc** The type of connection. For other connection types, see Service Types . private::rpcip The IP of the Service Node hosting this service. If left blank, localhost is assumed. private::rpcport** The service's RPC port. private::rpcuser** The service's RPC username. private::rpcpassword** The service's RPC password. private::rpccommand** The service's RPC command. private::response Used to hide private responses. For example, if this is a Twilio service and the user sends a text message, the service can send back a \"sent\" response instead of the Twilio response using private::response=sent . private:: Used to keep entries private. These will not be shared with connecting clients. # Used at the beginning of a line for public comments. These will be shared with connecting clients. #! Used at the beginning of a line for private comments. These will NOT be shared with connecting clients. ** Config entries private::type=rpc , private::rpcport , private::rpcuser , private::rpcpassword , and private::rpccommand are mandatory for RPC services. Note: Setting values use hierarchy priority. Values set under [Main] override the default values and become the new default settings for all services that don't have the respective setting specified. Service settings override [Main] and default settings. The setting hierarchy from highiest priority to lowest priority is as follows: Service Settings > [Main] > default . The higher priority settings override the lower priority settings. Tip: Add comments for service description and help messages. Using a public comment, add a description so users know what the service is. Example: #description: Returns the balance for the provided Ethereum address. Using a public comment, add a help message so users know how to use a service. Example: #help: eth_getBalance [address] [block_parameter]; [address] = (string) The address to check for balance; [block_parameter] = (string) Integer block number, or the string 'latest', 'earliest' or 'pending'. There are development plans to add dedicated, officially supported description and help settings. Docker \u00b6 Here is an example service config file: eth_getBalance.conf parameters=string fee=0.01 clientrequestlimit=100 private::type=docker private::containername=eth private::command=parity-cli eth_getBalance private::args=$1 private::quoteargs=1 !# Equivalent to: docker exec eth parity-cli eth_getBalance [address] [block_parameter] Settings Description parameters Optional.

If client requests exceed this value they will be penalized and eventually banned by your node. fetchlimit The maximum number of blocks processed. The default value is 50 (see note below). A value of -1 means there is no limit. disabled Used to disable a call. A value of 1 means the call is disabled and 0 means the call is enabled ( default - see note below). private::type=docker* The type of connection. For other connection types, see Service Types . private::containername* The name of the service's Docker container. private::command* The service's Docker command. private::args The arguments from parameters to pass to the command, denoted with a $ and the number of the argument passed as a parameter. The order the arguments are specified is the order they will be passed to the command. This order does not have to be the same order as used in parameters, although the numbers correlate with that order placement. You can pass additional values that haven't been passed as parameters (see example below). private::quoteargs Use this to quote the arguments in args . A value of 1 will quote each argument and 0 will not ( default - see note below). private::response Used to hide private responses. For example, if this is a Twilio service and the user sends a text message, the service can send back a \"sent\" response instead of the Twilio response using private::response=sent . private:: Used to keep entries private. These will not be shared with connecting clients. # Used at the beginning of a line for public comments. These will be shared with connecting clients. #!

There are development plans to add dedicated, officially supported description and help settings. Deploy Service \u00b6 Add the service name to the plugins= entry in xrouter.conf . The service name listed must be the exact name of your config file without the file extension. Separate each service name with a comma. Example: If you had 3 services that you wanted to deply with config names eth_getBalance.conf , eth_blockNumber.conf , and weatherData.conf , the plugins= setting would read as follows: plugins=eth_getBalance,eth_blockNumber,weatherData Use xrReloadConfigs to load your newly configured settings to xrouter.conf without needing to restart your Service Node. Use servicenodesendping to propogate these new settings to the network immediately or wait up to 3 minutes for this to happen automatically. You can view your configs using xrStatus ( See example output ). Post your services to the forum so others can discover, learn more, and find instructions on how to interact with your service. Additional Information \u00b6 Fees \u00b6 While Service Nodes can set their own fees, users can also set the max fee they will pay. Any Service Node's with a fee that is higher than a user's max fee will not be used. It is recommended to offer free calls for any call that are not computationally intesive. Lower fees will help encourage an ecosystem to build around the network. A healthy ecosystem will lead to much more usage of the network and receiving a lot of small fees will be more beneficial than receiving a few high fees. Granted, some calls may actually take computational time and will therefore require a higher fee. Snode Scoring \u00b6 Clients keep a score of each Service Node. When a Service Node reaches a score of -200 , the Service Node will be banned by the client for a 24hr period. After this 24hr period, the Service Node will start with a score of -25 . Action Change in Score Failure to respond to call within 30s -25 Failure to meet majority consensus -5 Matching consensus correct_nodes * 2 Sending bad XRouter config -10 Sending bad XCloud config -2 // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = []; Related Links \u00b6 var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

If you have not yet setup your Service Node, start with the Service Node Setup Guide . Note: XRouter requires a static IP For XRouter services, your Service Node Computer IP address must remain unchanged (static IP) and use port 42500 . If using a VPN with an IP that changes, it will impact your ability to provide XRouter services. XRouter makes direct connections and you'll need a WAN IP as your Service Node IP address and if it's behind a router you'll need to port-forward to it. XRouter is a decentralized interoperability protocol with an SPV client backend supported by Service Nodes that allows users to validate transactions and ensure transactions are in a block. These calls are supported by default if XRouter is enabled with no additional settings. For example, if you have a fully synced Bitcoin node with txindex on, you can use XRouter to sell transaction information on Bitcoin's blockchain. So if a user doesn't want to download the full chain, but needs to know information about a transaction, they could query your XRouter node and you can charge them a fee to do so. You have the option to offer these services for free or to charge a fee for each call. Fees can be set to be specific for each individual call. To setup XRouter, follow these steps: Configure XRouter Optimize Setup Deploy SPV Wallets Additional Information Setup XCloud (option): XCloud is a decentralized microservice cloud network that allows you to monetize any microservice, blockchain, API, or cloud tech on your own hardware, many cases without having to write any code. Configure XRouter \u00b6 When starting the wallet, an xrouter.conf file is automatically created in the Scalaris wallet data directory if not already present. The xrouter.conf file is used to specify all your general XRouter settings and SPV call settings. Note: SPV support also requires xbridge.conf configuration. To support SPV calls, you must also have your xbridge.conf file setup for each of the chains you wish to support and those wallets must remain open and running ( view XBridge setup guide ). For ETH, you will also need JSONVersion=2.0 and ContentType=application/json added to the [ETH] entry in xbridge.conf . This applies to GETH and Parity clients. Similar to xbridge.conf , the general XRouter settings are specified under a [Main] heading. Settings Description host The static public IP address of your SNode Computer. wallets The wallets you'd like to support XRouter calls on. All commands are on by default for all supported wallets listed in wallets= . If you want to turn one of them off, set disabled=1 in the call's subsection. plugins The XCloud services you are supporting, see XCloud Configuration . fee The fee (in SCA) you require for calls. A value of 0 means there is no fee and that the calls are free ( default ). Fees can be specified for individual calls in each subsection. clientrequestlimit The minimum time allowed between calls in milliseconds. A value of -1 means there is no limit ( default ). If client requests exceed this value they will be penalized and eventually banned by your node. disabled** Used to disable a call. A value of 1 means the call is disabled and 0 means the call is enabled ( default ). This setting is only for subsections and not supported under [Main] . fetchlimit The maximum number of records returned. This pertains to calls such as xrGetBlocks and xrGetTransactions where multiple records are returned. The default value is 50 . A value of -1 means there is no limit. ** Only for subsection settings, not supported under [Main] . Note: Setting values use hierarchy priority. Values set under [Main] override the default values and become the new default settings for all subsections that don't have the respective setting specified. Subsection settings override [Main] and default settings. Wallet-specific subsections have the highest priority and override all other settings. The setting hierarchy from highiest priority to lowest priority is as follows: [BTC::xrGetBlockCount] > [BTC] > [xrGetBlockCount] > [Main] > default . The higher priority settings override the lower priority settings. Note: The host and wallets settings are required. In your xrouter.conf you must have host= and wallets= included and specified or it will be invalid. Example xrouter.conf : [Main] host=208.67.222.222 wallets=SCA,SYS,BTC plugins= fee=0 paymentaddress= clientrequestlimit=50 [xrGetBlockCount] fee=0.01 [xrGetBlockHash] fee=0.01 [xrGetTransaction] fee=0.1 clientrequestlimit=20 [BTC::xrGetTransactions] fee=0.5 timeout=50 fetchlimit=20 [BTC::xrGetBlocks] fee=0.3 timeout=30 fetchlimit=20 [xrGetBlocks] disabled=1 fetchlimit=50 Here is a list of current SPV calls: Call Description xrGetBlockCount Returns a blockchain's block height xrGetBlockHash Returns a block number's hash xrGetBlock Returns a block hash's block number xrGetBlocks Returns block hashes for multiple block numbers xrDecodeRawTransaction Returns decoded transaction HEX xrGetTransaction Returns transaction data for transaction ID xrGetTransactions Returns transaction data for multiple transaction IDs xrSendTransaction Submit a signed transaction to the network Optimize Setup \u00b6 Note: XRouter requires a static IP For XRouter services, your Service Node Computer IP address must remain unchanged (static IP) and use port 42500 . If using a VPN with an IP that changes, it will impact your ability to provide XRouter services. XRouter makes direct connections and you'll need a WAN IP as your Service Node IP address and if it's behind a router you'll need to port-forward to it. SNode Computer scalaris.conf Optimizations For the scalaris.conf on the SNode Computer wallet: maxconnections= should NOT be specified. rpcthreads= should be set to the number of blockchains you are supporting (if running 24 blockchains, set rpcthreads=24 ). If you are running less than 8 blockchains then it should remain at rpcthreads=8 as the minimum. After making these changes you will need to restart your Service Node Scalaris wallet. Deploy SPV Wallets \u00b6 Add the chains you want to support SPV calls for in the wallets= entry in xrouter.conf , denoted by the chain's asset's ticker. Separate each wallet name with a comma. Example: wallets=SYS,SCA,BTC,ETH,MNP If you added or removed blockchain support, make sure to also update the rpcthreads= value in the scalaris.conf file. Use xrReloadConfigs to load your newly configured settings to xrouter.conf without needing to restart your Service Node. Use servicenodesendping to propogate these new settings to the network immediately or wait up to 3 minutes for this to happen automatically. You can view your configs using xrStatus . Additional Information \u00b6 Fees \u00b6 While Service Nodes can set their own fees, users can also set the max fee they will pay. Any Service Node's with a fee that is higher than a user's max fee will not be used. It is recommended to offer free calls for any call that are not computationally intesive. Lower fees will help encourage an ecosystem to build around the network. A healthy ecosystem will lead to much more usage of the network and receiving a lot of small fees will be more beneficial than receiving a few high fees. Granted, some calls may actually take computational time and will therefore require a higher fee. SNode Scoring \u00b6 Clients keep a score of each Service Node. When a Service Node reaches a score of -200 , the Service Node will be banned by the client for a 24hr period. After this 24hr period, the Service Node will start with a score of -25 . Action Change in Score Failure to respond to call within 30s -25 Failure to meet majority consensus -5 Matching consensus correct_nodes * 2 Sending bad XRouter config -10 Sending bad XCloud config -2 // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = []; Related Links \u00b6 var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!

In a perfect world, everybody running the Scalaris blockchain would have identical data and transaction history. However in the real world, technical events such as a wallet or protocol upgrade may cause a user's blockchain to start having different data after a certain point. The start of a fork is the point at which the blockchain data starts to differ. If you are the user with the different data from everyone else, then you are on a fork (forked chain). Note: SCA staked on a fork are not valid on the main chain. If you are on a fork you will likely earn many more staking rewards than usual. Many people mistaken continue to stay on the fork on purpose thinking that the SCA earned can be used on the main chain, which is incorrect. Once you get back on the main chain, there will be no record of any actions performed on a fork. In this case, being on a fork is similar to being in a parallel universe. Check If You Are on a Fork \u00b6 Use the following guide to check if you're on a fork by comparing the current block height of your wallet with the block height on the explorer. Check using wallet Select Tools from the left menu, then the Debug Console tab. The input field at the bottom is where you will type commands. Type getblockcount into the debug console and press the Enter or Return key. getblockcount The command will appear in the console window followed by a response with your current block height. Type getblockhash <BLOCK HEIGHT> into the debug console with <BLOCK HEIGHT> replaced with the block height returned in the previous step and press the Enter or Return key. Example: getblockhash 11050942 The command will appear in the console window followed by a response with the hash of your current block height. Open a Scalaris blockchain explorer: visit explorer.scalaris.info Type the block height returned in step 4 into the search bar and press the Enter or Return key. The search result will return the hash of the block. Compare the returned block hash form the explorer with the block hash from your wallet returned in step 6. If the block hashed are different then you are on a fork. There is a chance that the explorer is on a fork, but this is much less likely to be the case. If you are on a fork, backup your wallet.dat file. And re-sync blockchain. Troubleshooting If you encounter issues, please join Scalaris's Discord or join Scalaris's Telegram for assistance.

Depending on how you downloaded it, it's possible the file may have been modified in transit to do something evil when run. The server hosting the download may also have been compromised. Get the sha256 hash of the release you download. These are provided on the Github release page either in a file called sha256sums.txt or as a plain text in the release notes. The format follows SHA256(filename)= hash . Here is an example of the hashes: 53B3B4CA8688EE81284D3DE8C585038BBA776EB1978F5B01C618BE4ED4C43847 scalaris-1.0.0-aarch64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz 0D74585ADBCA407B671A2D4F5314A8E3743F45C8BEA89E92E221673C38178EEB scalaris-1.0.0-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz CCB060CDFB1C746774DDE597797711FE533A1ECBDDBBC27DDAAF4336D39BD7A2 scalaris-1.0.0-arm-linux-gnueabihf-debug.tar.gz 7DC865B10C7B6AFE1F6E8AF5ADFEAFE7C5303EB13F26775AD8F70EF6AE2FC141 scalaris-1.0.0-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz 1BD5008C6F5928D3E66A30EACC22E92A013E16AD92BA4DEB59EFE910B9686C75 scalaris-1.0.0-osx-unsigned.dmg 6CE1E12F96B47284BA820529203CDAD28F513E851E82EEEB9A9F8BEB8170E2DB scalaris-1.0.0-osx-unsigned.tar.gz 4DDBF8AFD65CCD737915241E756C67A2F37D6DFA02691A6D6E658C851B66CEA0 scalaris-1.0.0-osx64.tar.gz 29DBB3DC45B260C13BC3BA6B9F19C734959C67859E8B62CD97660CDB11B253B6 scalaris-1.0.0-riscv64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz D929A2F0C90215FF973F5101CA42E75FE1F63E70440D994E2779161C37097651 scalaris-1.0.0-riscv64-linux-gnu.tar.gz F6E4F4D1ABE5ED23EF3373FFA140C3518E95AB1BCB86ABDDE91D836C84EF9587 scalaris-1.0.0-win-unsigned.tar.gz 2C1EDC6735063A015D9CB7DBC2A21BD1ECFD6E4ED1FE2C7F73CEC3E4A78752B7 scalaris-1.0.0-win64-debug.zip 319305F318F0F9B3BE5A4D3F52EB8E0C47CD952418D948627C1B4F259783B075 scalaris-1.0.0-win64-setup-unsigned.exe 58364BDC30FA791E12E40F5244BCC9DADCA3EC1019F23CC3F54010DD0A8049DD scalaris-1.0.0-win64.zip 301167FC91699DB555FE84AAE06BE9C4429213907DC4CDB64C88BCDA9B91D57F scalaris-1.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz 8A4A2AC9EFB752967ADD9AE9A7F9C17AE879D64BAD5EEF70324937FE021E3FB7 scalaris-1.0.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz Take a note of the hash for the specific file you downloaded.

Make sure there's SCA in your wallet. Unlock the wallet for staking only . It may take a minute for the staking to activate. You can verify the wallet is staking with the status icon in the upper-right corner. The 2nd icon from the left indicates the staking status. If it is Red, staking is inactive. If it is Green, staking is active. You can also hover over the icon to read the staking status. Note: Staking will not activate if the wallet is not synced. Since staking is the act of confirming the latest transactions, staking cannot be active until the wallet is synced to the more recent transaction on the network. Note: Newly deposited SCA can't stake for 60 minutes. Funds cannot stake until they have had 60 confirmation on the network.

This is a normal part of staking. The funds in your wallet that \"won\" the staking reward will remain immature until they have 101 confirmations (101 minutes).

Staking Rewards \u00b6 Probability \u00b6 The selection of the staker that confirms each block is probability-based. This means that everyone\u2019s chance of being selected to confirm the next block is equal to the amount of SCA staking divided by the total amount of SCA being staked on the network. Example: Calculating staking reward probability. Assume: You're staking 5000 SCA There's a total of 3,325,000 SCA active staking on the network The probability you will earn the next reward is: 5000 / 3325000 = 0.0015 * 100 = 0.15% This means that, on average, you will earn a reward every: 1 / 0.0015 = 665 minutes = 11.08 hours And the average amount of SCA rewarded per day is: 1440 minutes a day / 665 minutes per reward * 1 SCA per reward = 2.16 SCA With SCA valued example at $2, that would equate to $4,32 per day and $1576,8 per year. ROI \u00b6 Building off the probabilistic ratio above, the following equation can be derived to estimate the yearly return (in SCA) on the initial amount started with. This does not account for compounding, which would increase this value. Staking ROI = ( [525600] / [total SCA staked on the network] ) * 100 525600 = 1 SCA reward per minute * 1440 minutes per day * 365 days per year Example: Calculating staking reward ROI. Assume: There's a total of 3,325,000 SCA staking on the network The amount you're staking is irrelevant because ROI is a per unit value The yearly ROI under these conditions will be: 525600 / 3325000 = 0.158 * 100 = 15.8% This means that in a year, if you staked 1000 SCA the rewards would be: 1000 * 0.158 = 158 SCA With SCA valued at $2, that would equate to $316 per year. // read instructions for related links in ../snippets/extras.md var relatedLinks = []; Related Links \u00b6 var relatedHTML = \"<ul>\"; // check if related links provide if (typeof variable !== 'undefined' && relatedLinks.length > 0) { // related links provided, loop through them for (let i = 0; i < relatedLinks.length; i++) { // create a list element with an a tag containing the related link var snippet = \"<li><a href='\" + relatedLinks[i][\"link\"] + \"'>\" + relatedLinks[i][\"name\"] + \"</a></li>\"; // concatenate element to relatedHTML variable relatedHTML += snippet; } // concatenate list closing tag relatedHTML += \"</ul>\"; // add list of related links to the related page links section document.getElementById(\"related\").innerHTML = relatedHTML; } else { // no related links provided // remove related links section header document.getElementById(\"related-links\").outerHTML = \"\"; // remove related links section from sidebar menu document.querySelector(\".md-sidebar--secondary .md-nav__list\").lastElementChild.remove(); } #notification-bar { width: 100vw; position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; z-index: 1000; box-shadow: 0px -1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); margin-bottom: -1px; opacity: 1; animation-name: bn-notification-load; animation-duration: 0.8s; } #notification-bar .notification { position: relative; min-height: 20px; text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); padding: 12px 50px 12px 20px; background-color: #016AFF; color: #fff; } #notification-bar .message { display: inline-block; line-height: 17px; } #notification-bar .message a { color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; } #notification-bar .notification-close { display: inline-block; position: absolute; right: 5px; top: 50%; height: 50px; width: 50px; transform: translate(0%,-50%); line-height: 50px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em; cursor: pointer; } @keyframes bn-notification-load { from {opacity: 0;} to {opacity: 1;} } XRouter Beta Released!
